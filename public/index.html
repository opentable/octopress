  <div class="entry-content"><p>Those of you that read this blog on a regular basis will be aware that here at OpenTable we take our commitment to Open Source very seriously. As part of the infrastructure team at OpenTable we are begining a process of being open-first. That means that everything we write will be open-sourced unless it contains a significant amount of internal information but we will architect to limit this.</p>

<p>As part of that commitment we are trying to release all our Puppet configuration. The key to maintaining any good habit is to do little and often and with that in mind we wanted to let you know about ForgeFriday.</p>

<p>Every Friday we will be releasing our Puppet code onto the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable">PuppetLabs Forge</a> (until we run out of modules). That means all our windows modules, all our forks, our experiments, our custom facts and functions - anything and everything will start rolling out on Friday&#8217;s.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just forge and forget either, we will continue to support all of our modules and those that use them. We will blog about some of the bigger, more important ones and continue to engage with the community as much as possible. If your using our modules (even if you have no issues) then let us know - we&#8217;d love to hear from you.</p>

<p>In this mean time go and check out what we have already released:</p>

<p><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/windowsfeature">opentable/windowsfeature</a> - Module that will turn windows features on or off<br/>
<a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/iis_rewrite">opentable/iis_rewrite</a> - Module that will install the IIS Rewrite 2.0 Module on Windows <br/>
<a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/remaster">opentable/remaster</a> - Module for managing the remaster of agent nodes <br/>
<a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/puppetversion">opentable/puppetversion</a> - Module for managing the installation and upgrade of puppet <br/>
<a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/altlib">opentable/altlib</a> - Module providing some additional useful functions <br/></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I18n is often a painful afterthought when serving content from a http-api. It can be taken for granted and tacked on using nasty query string values. But thankfully HTTP provides us with a solid gold opportunity. If you can look past the mire of content negotiation you can see the nuggets that lie inside.</p>

<p>The accept-language header is used by most browsers and allows websites to serve content in a language that the user can (hopefully) understand. When we expose content from an api (in most of our use cases, at least), this content eventually ends up in front of a human (in some shape or form). Having our service-service communication serve localised resources can be invaluable because it frees the clients from having to think about i18n of the resources being served from our api.</p>

<p>It is a simple part of the HTTP specification and is widely used and supported.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>GET /product/123
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Language: en-US</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The accept-language header is specifically designed to allow the server to provide a representation of the resource which approximates something the client can understand.</p>

<p>The really useful bit comes from the quality value.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>GET /product/123
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This header asks the service to provide en-US, and if it&#8217;s unavailable then fall back to <strong>any</strong> english representation. The quality value (<code>q=0.8</code>) is a decimal value between 0 and 1 which indicates order of preference when specifying multiple languages. The server should pick the <strong>first</strong> available match. If there are multiple matches with the same quality value, then the server can pick any. If the client wants to specify some fierce preferences then they can crank out something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>GET /product/123
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Language: fr-CA,fr-FR;q=0.8,fr;q=0.6,en-US;q=0.4,en;q=0.2,*;q=0.1</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you decipher this it&#8217;s pretty simple, you can see the quality headers giving the order in which the languages are preferred. What it does is give the client fantastic flexibility. For service-service communication you might have a use-case which will <em>never</em> serve a representation that doesn&#8217;t match the request, or you might need to <em>always</em> provide some representation (i.e. for cases where some content is always better than none).</p>

<p>The accept-language header gives you that flexibility. In my opinon, if your http-api&#8217;s are serving content that <em>can</em> be internationalised, the server should always support this type of behaviour because it can shift the control from the server to the client. It allows the server&#8217;s behaviour to be incredibly explicit and the clients get all that lovely flexibility.</p>

<p><strong>What happens when there is no matching representation?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the specification is (intentionally) vague. In other words, it is up to the server to decide. I myself always prefer to be explicit. Thankfully the HTTP specification provides for just such an eventuality.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html">HTTP 406 Not Acceptable</a> <em>&#8220;The resource identified by the request is only capable of generating response entities which have content characteristics not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>The 406 response <em>should</em> contain a list of characteristics which the resource does support. In this case, a list of available languages. The specification does allow the server to automatically select a representation to return, however in my opinion, the server should be explicit, rather than implicit.</p>

<p>If the client has a use case where it <em>always</em> requires some sort of response (i.e. where any content is better than no content), then the client can append a wildcard to the end of the accept-language header, which will instruct the server to fall back to <em>any</em> language, in the event that there are none matching.</p>

<p><strong>Parsing the Accept-Language header</strong></p>

<p>I wrote a little npm module to help us in <a href="https://github.com/andyroyle/accept-language-parser">parsing the accept-language header</a>. Once you get past the (somewhat hairy) regex, it&#8217;s a simple little bit of code. (Disclaimer, I&#8217;m not a regex god, so there are a couple of little bugs in it).</p>

<p>Parsing an accept-language string such as <code>en-US,en;q=0.8</code> gives an object looking like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[
</span><span class='line'>  {
</span><span class='line'>    code: "en",
</span><span class='line'>    region: "GB",
</span><span class='line'>    quality: 1.0
</span><span class='line'>  },
</span><span class='line'>  {
</span><span class='line'>    code: "en",
</span><span class='line'>    region: undefined,
</span><span class='line'>    quality: 0.8
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>];</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Output is always sorted in quality order from highest -> lowest. as per the http spec, omitting the quality value implies 1.0.</p>

<p>We can pass this around our application and use it to select the representation which best matches the client&#8217;s request.</p>

<p><strong>Using it</strong></p>

<p>We use <a href="http://hapijs.com">hapi.js</a> for some of our api&#8217;s (and I&#8217;m very much in love), we use this module in a pre-requisite handler in our route:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var alparser = require('accept-language-parser');
</span><span class='line'>server.route({
</span><span class='line'>  method: "GET",
</span><span class='line'>  path: "/v5/restaurants/{id}",
</span><span class='line'>  config: {
</span><span class='line'>    pre: [
</span><span class='line'>      {
</span><span class='line'>        method: function(req, next){
</span><span class='line'>          next(alparser.parse(req.raw.req.headers["accept-language"] || ""));
</span><span class='line'>        },
</span><span class='line'>        assign: "language",
</span><span class='line'>        mode: "parallel"
</span><span class='line'>      }
</span><span class='line'>    ],
</span><span class='line'>    handler: function(req, reply){
</span><span class='line'>        ...
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>});</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For those of you that don&#8217;t know, the prerequisites run before the handler, and assign their values to the request object. You can now get hold of the parsed language object here:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>req.pre.language</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Content-Negotiation is hard</strong></p>

<p>Yes, it is. But suck it up. In my opinion the benefits outweigh the costs. Besides, the Accept-Language header is part of the HTTP specification and is well understood. If you have doubts, start small, and always try to be <em>explicit</em> rather than implicit.</p>

<p><strong>Gotchas</strong></p>

<p>Caching (both client-side and intermediate) can be picky. By default, most caches won&#8217;t respect the header content (i.e. the resource is cached by url only). You can get around this by using vary-headers:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>GET /product/123
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.8
</span><span class='line'>Vary: Accept-Language</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This instructs the cache that the response will vary with the value of Accept-Language, so when this changes it should be cached as a separate resource. Vary headers <strong>should</strong> be applied by the client to the request, however the server can apply them to the response if necessary.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="/blog/2014/03/19/performance-testing-our-search-api/">my last post</a> about performance testing I wrote about how we decided to do it in production as the ultimate test of success. Performance testing in production is enough to make some operations guys have a panic attack and a few odd looks were dished my way when I raised it on behalf of the team.</p>

<h2>Why not have a dedicated environment?</h2>

<p>If you can have a dedicated environment that you can build to be EXACTLY the same as where you are going to really need the performance (i.e. your production environment most likely, but possibly on a client machine) then do it in a dedicated, duplicated environment. Alternatively if there is no way you can use the production environment or your model means that everything will scale exactly like production, then a duplicate environment might work.</p>

<p>For us, we had too many dependencies, mocking these out wasn&#8217;t really satisfactory and frankly, as a business where we are quiet at night, it is easy to use the production environment at these times. We use configuration management and virtual machines, much of what should help build a replica environment, but we also have machines in restaurants around the globe. That is not easy to replicate and not worth the effort.</p>

<h2>Even if you can have a duplicated environment should you?</h2>

<p>We felt in the search team that we just wouldn&#8217;t uncover a broken server (that can affect performance) or we wouldn&#8217;t see that we had a problem with interactions with these services (we have now got to serialisation as our bottleneck, maybe we would have missed that).</p>

<p>We just didn&#8217;t trust that a duplicated environment would actually help us in this case. If you want to test a new idea as a prototype then the duplicate will probably work, even if just at first, we were trying to improve our actual environment.</p>

<h2>Is testing in production right?</h2>

<p>There is no &#8216;right&#8217; answer here, plenty of people test in a duplicate environment and then monitor in production. I think this is probably a valid approach and in a lot of use cases this would be fine for us too.</p>

<p>Can you micro-optimise in a huge production system?  Probably not, so use a scaled down duplicate for that or even a local environment such as one created using Vagrant. Hopefully with enough micro-optimisations you will eventually see these in a larger environment.</p>

<h2>Is it a free lunch?</h2>

<p>Testing in production is not a free lunch. Even simple things like system logging will cost as you will be logging to production data centres, probably with backup costs etc. Do you need to code-in safeguards? Yes, and you will need to watch this running from your desk. When you are not watching it will be hard to be sure you will not cause production issues. We can use our regional environment that means we are testing during our day, that region&#8217;s night, other companies might see you having to work in your timezone&#8217;s evening &ndash; not fun.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>Whilst, on the face of it, testing in production seems crazy, with all things considered we found it the easiest, most reliable and frankly most reassuring environment in which to test.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was midnight on the Friday before Christmas, my seven-week old child was tucked up asleep and I was pretty chilled. All was calm and it was time for bed. Two minutes later I had a phone call, followed by a series of Nagios email alerts, and a need to put my work hat on quickly. The search API was having trouble; as the manager of the team who developed it, I was not looking forward to this. We were having a real slowdown at one of our busiest times of the year &ndash; this was going to be fun.</p>

<p>Once the dust settled and we were back up and running we realised we needed to do a better job of performance testing and actually solve any performance issues. We <em>had</em> done some performance testing but clearly not the right kind.</p>

<h2>What had gone wrong?</h2>

<p>We were indexing our data too frequently, and under load it started to take a long time. We created a race condition where multiple indexing operations started happening. As each operation assumed the previous one had either failed or finished a vicious circle occurred making the situation worse and worse.</p>

<p>The simple fix was just to index the data less often or not at all if another operation was running, however we wanted to get to the bottom of why we slowed down under load which exposed this race condition, improve that speed and understand what is the maximum load the system can take.</p>

<h2>Getting a benchmark</h2>

<p>In order to know if we were actually making improvements we needed to be able to recreate load and see the impact. In order to do this and truly appreciate how it was going we needed to use our live environment &ndash; the only environment I felt we could truly understand. My next post will explain why we felt this was the best environment for the job.</p>

<p>With search and availability it is actually quite hard to use response times as a benchmark and the name of this exercise was really to cope with greater load. Response times are still nice to improve though so we were tracking them, but not using them as our main benchmark.</p>

<h2>Some perspective on our problem domain</h2>

<p>We do not have a large index, in the tens of thousands of restaurants rather than millions of tweets for example. We have to merge in table availability (the fantastic thing about the OpenTable system) to the more static restaurant information. We also have large page sizes, needing to get up to 2,500 results out of one Elastic Search request. This proved to be relevant.</p>

<p>We also have an autocomplete search endpoint served out of the same infrastructure. That was not heavy in terms of resource usage but we still noted it slowed down when peak load was happening.</p>

<h2>Initial ideas to investigate</h2>

<p>We brainstormed a few things to investigate and assess as potential performance improvements. As we were still relatively new to Elastic Search (ES), a lot of these were related to the configuration of ES itself.</p>

<ul>
<li>Improved sharding strategy (we were using the default)</li>
<li>Check we were <a href="http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/Elasticsearch-Filter-And-Query-td4027675.html">filtering before querying</a></li>
<li>Check the <a href="http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/Performance-of-term-query-with-sorting-td4032901.html">sorting was efficient</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-optimize.html">Optimise the index</a> as part of the indexing process</li>
<li><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-optimize.html">Slow log</a> checking</li>
<li>Check how we were using the <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-source-field.html">source</a> in the index</li>
<li>Warm-up the index after it is built</li>
<li>Gzip between API boxes and ES</li>
<li>Check connection pool is a singleton, internal detail</li>
<li>Delete old indexes more rigorously (we have a new index each release)</li>
<li>Check <a href="http://grokbase.com/t/gg/elasticsearch/13bezebw1p/garbage-collector-issues">garbage collection</a> on ES boxes</li>
<li>Check <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/logstash-users/gfTTbRABk1M">swappiness</a> settings on ES boxes</li>
<li>Split different search types to different hardware</li>
</ul>


<h2>Now, we learned, we were a bit stupid.</h2>

<p>Once we worked through a few things, our main findings showed that we had made some rookie errors.</p>

<p>We had a sharding policy that is great for large indexes but we only needed one shard replicated on each ES server in the cluster. Changing that helped reduce the load across servers as each server could do our queries entirely.</p>

<p>Through Elastic HQ (<a href="http://www.elastichq.org/">the useful plugin to ES</a>) we got the rather crude red boxes for various metrics on the diagnostics page. The two that stood out were high Garbage Collection and disk swaps. The main thing causing this was that we were using OpenJDK instead of the Oracle JVM. If you are using OpenJDK, change it now! The swappiness setting was less impactful but resolved some of the issues caused by the frequent writing to disk.</p>

<p>Now we increased scale well, until we moved our bottleneck from our Elastic Search cluster to our API boxes.</p>

<h2>And some things are limits of the technology</h2>

<p>Now the API boxes were the problem we realised that basically serialisation and deserialisation is the bottleneck. The number of boxes can be scaled out (more servers) or serialisation removed. Also your programming language can be the limiting factor here. So we are now looking around at the best language as an option for speeding things up.</p>

<h2>So what now</h2>

<p>We have tweaked the ES set-up and scaled out our API servers and our benchmark improved (the amount of traffic can we serve). We have a roadmap for how to take more and more traffic but the response time is probably as fast as we can go if we keep the same methodology. As a result we are actually looking at using Elastic Search a lot less than we originally planned. We need to take serialisation out of the game where possible, using in-memory filtering seems a candidate again.</p>

<h2>That&#8217;s it for Elastic Search?</h2>

<p>Not at all, we love it. We are definitely still going to use for autocomplete, free-text search and also other indexing we want to do with future feature plans we have.</p>

<p>It was our fault we made some stupid errors with it, but our architecture and technology decisions just prevent us using it for our one, currently most important, use case, right now.</p>

<p>Also solving serialisation issues creatively might mean we can use ES again.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Get performance testing into your deployment pipeline, consider testing in production and expect the worst. The worst being that you might have got something stupid wrong and it is only exposed when you really don&#8217;t want it to be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I joined OpenTable I’ve been experimenting with performance monitoring, specifically on web services. One of the projects my team is responsible for is a REST API that provides UI elements for HTML5 applications, shaped as HTML snippets and static resources. Our consumers are websites deployed in multiple parts of the world, so our service needs to be fast and reliable.</p>

<h2>The why</h2>

<p>A couple of weeks after joining the company I decided, as part of my <a href="http://tech.toptable.co.uk/blog/2014/02/06/20-percent-time/">innovation time</a>, to rebuild the core of a .NET WebApi project in node.js in order to have a working prototype that could do exactly the same job as the original one, and could help me to observe how the two applications could react with similar volumes of traffic. After managing to make the two apis run on two clean VMs with the same configuration, I wrote a little node.js script to start performing some requests and test the response times. After seeing the results I thought that something was going wrong:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>After trying to microbenchmark different layers of the software, I found the problem. On the .NET side I was reading a file synchronously, for every request; the file system’s library used with the node.js app, instead, was automatically caching the reads as default. After setting up a basic caching mechanism in the .NET app and running my script again the node.js API was only 1.4 times faster. After finding and solving that issue I thought how badly the application could have handled concurrency when deployed in production, even if it was heavily unit tested, the specs were well defined, and it was built using all the best techniques we all love.</p>

<p>As developers we rely on technologies that, with a minimum effort, can guarantee some pretty decent results in terms of performance. Modern web frameworks handle concurrency and thread management without requiring much plumbing code. Sophisticated and relatively cheap cloud services help us monitor our applications, providing dashboards, reports and alerting systems. Deploying on the cloud we can run our services and even auto-scale them depending on how much power we need. Even with these tools we must still own the responsibility of writing good quality code, testing it properly, and deploying as fast as possible in order to optimise the delivery process of our products.</p>

<p>But what about performance? I mean, what about the relationship between the code we write every day, and the way we impact overall performance? Are we sure that we are not deploying to production something that is degrading our services’ performance?</p>

<h2>The how</h2>

<p>Talking about the ‘why’ could be relatively easy, but the ‘how’ is a controversial topic. In my experience there are three important steps to any dish. First, we need the right tools to manipulate the ingredients. I tried many different tools but I couldn&#8217;t find a good fit for all my benchmarking requirements. It always makes sense to start with something to get you going but after a while it is important to find what’s the best for you, your team, and your project.</p>

<p>Then, you start cooking: personally, the number of things I’ve learned by just starting to benchmark some services is incredible. Nevertheless, as with every time we talk about metrics, it is key to know what is important about the data we are analysing, recognise the false positives/negatives and be aware of vanity metrics that could emphasize something irrelevant, or, more importantly, hide something significant.</p>

<p>The last step is simple: react and persist. If you discover something relevant, you can do something to improve the quality of your software.  With the right tools you can write some benchmark tests to target different layers of your software and execute them each and every time you contribute to that repository.  Doing this helps you keep your system performance under control which is really valuable.</p>

<h2>The how, for me</h2>

<p>When I found that little bug in the application (and it wasn’t actually a bug in the way we usually define them, as it wasn’t breaking any test or any software’s feature), I decided to spend some time to make my benchmark script better, in order to support different HTTP verbs, HTTPS, and a few things I needed to test all the routes of the API in a easy way. The goal was to wrap my little script as a <a href="http://www.gruntjs.com">grunt.js</a> module, (we use Teamcity as a CI platform and we already use grunt to run various tasks during our release process). I wanted to run this benchmarks externally to avoid interfering with the performance of the application, and to have a configuration-based simple-to-use tool.</p>

<p>So after some refactoring I started working on <a href="https://github.com/matteofigus/api-benchmark">api-benchmark</a> and its grunt wrapper <a href="https://github.com/matteofigus/grunt-api-benchmark">grunt-api-benchmark</a>, in order to make performance testing part of our continuous delivery process. A couple of days later my team was using it to run benchmark tests on our pre-prod environments against our APIs, running some hundreds of requests on each route every time we made a single commit to Github. What I managed to do was to break the build if response times were not good enough (stopping the production deployment), and producing a tiny report with some graphs, in order to have something useful to observe and eventually collect. Now, a couple of months later, a lot of functionality has been added and other teams are using it with success.</p>

<p>In case of RESTful services, it is possible to make series of requests to test response times, find peaks and classify errors; it is possible to perform concurrent calls to see how many parallel requests your service can handle (when deployed in single boxes, or when load balanced and globalised); and every time grunt runs everything is saved and plotted to readable and shareable graphs, so the knowledge can be shared between people that belong to different backgrounds.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/api_benchmark.png"></p>

<p>A lot of other features are still under development, including support for SOAP services and historical analysis (compare results from previous benchmarks and create historical graphs to represent the evolution of your software).</p>

<h2>How it works &amp; how to use it</h2>

<p>The way it works is simple. A configuration file contains the list of all the routes of the API. For each route it is possible to set different parameters such as headers, methods, expected status code, and expected response times. Other options that can be set such as the minimum number of samples, the maximum time for collecting the results, the number of concurrent requests, etc. It should be something like:</p>

<p>Then it is possible to include the script in a project that is written in any language and runs on any platform. The only requirement is to <a href="http://www.nodejs.org">install node.js</a> on that machine. If the project doesn’t have a package.json file in the root of your project, it’s as easy as doing:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>npm init
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once this is complete, include and install grunt-api-benchmark as a dependency (if you are not on Windows, you may want to sudo it depending on how you’ve installed node.js):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>npm install grunt-api-benchmark --save-dev
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The last thing to do is to create a task inside your Gruntfile.js. Create one if you already don’t have one, and then add the ‘api_benchmark’ task in order to have something like this:</p>

<h2>Let’s benchmark - some lessons learned</h2>

<p>I think this is the most important part of the whole process, however I don’t think there are any general rules that are applicable for every context. I believe that after testing and stressing your system you will find out what matters to you and to your business. Nevertheless, I want to share some of the lessons I’ve learned.</p>

<p>First, set-up everything correctly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Benchmarks need to run always on the same machine, same agent, and same configuration to be reliable and comparable.</li>
<li>The network should be tested to be sure there aren’t any particular limits that would affect the benchmarks. It should be tested each time before running any benchmarks and could include things like bandwidth, host name correctness, and OS limitations.</li>
<li>Don’t run the tests from the same machine that hosts the application. Run it from the outside, and if you deploy in different regions, keep that in mind when you look at the results.</li>
</ul>


<p>When you benchmark, remember that stress and performance are two different things.</p>

<ul>
<li>You should test both to learn about performance but also your limits, in order to have an idea on how to scale your application or how to fix it when necessary.</li>
<li>10 seconds is not enough. 1 minute is nice, 5 is better.</li>
<li>One route is not enough. Testing all the routes allow us to see the difference between different response lengths.</li>
<li>Sometimes your application needs a warm-up, especially if you test it after a deployment. Set up a script to do that or set a proper time-out to be sure you are retrieving some valuable numbers back.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t benchmark the live production environment. Your results are affected by too many variables. If possible, set-up a staging environment with exactly the same configuration to run benchmarks.</li>
</ul>


<p>If necessary, adapt your API to be more testable through some very basic design patterns.</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance could depend on synchronous calls to third-party APIs or databases. Ideally routes should have an optional parameter to mock external dependencies so we should test that as well.</li>
<li>Ensure that changes to data or the operating environment are not persisted after the benchmarks complete. This is important to ensure no side effects on subsequent runs and will allow you to  benchmark production boxes if needed (after the deployment and obviously before directing any traffic to them).</li>
</ul>


<p>Last but not least, let’s analyse the data</p>

<ul>
<li>Averages are not enough, peaks are important, investigate them.</li>
<li>When something unexpected happens, try to reproduce it in order to fix it.</li>
<li>If wildly different numbers come up every time you run the tests, your API is depending on too many unpredictable events. Try to fix it. Try to run benchmarks locally and microbenchmark your software until you find the element that is causing the unpredictability. Then, fix it or find a way to mock it if you have no other option.</li>
<li>Numbers should be readable and shareable by everyone. Find a tool that dashboards your results and easily allow you to share that data.</li>
</ul>


<h2>‘benchmarking’ != ‘monitoring’;</h2>

<p>Benchmarking doesn’t equal and doesn’t replace monitoring. Once you start having an extensive knowledge about your system’s performance, you can find useful and easy to establish correlations between your benchmarks and your monitoring metrics. Depending on the scale of your system, it could be something very important.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I believe that taking care of performance is our responsibility, as developers. We can and should do more, and I hope this subject will gain more interest. In the meanwhile, if <a href="https://github.com/matteofigus/api-benchmark">api-benchmark</a> sounds interesting for you and you are interested in trying it or contributing (it is totally open-source), don’t hesitate to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/matteofigus">get in touch with me</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Popular topic at conferences</h2>

<p>A lot of us were lucky enough to attend NDC London this year, we even sponsored one of the food stalls. I often see one or more real themes coming from talks at conferences. At NDC London I saw three talks around scaling Agile. Indeed Dan North&#8217;s (<a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod">@tastapod</a>) talk was called exactly that. It is a topic OpenTable is trying to make happen. We are about 100 engineers on three continents which is a lot of teams working together.</p>

<p>I truly believe that the only way to make an individual team successful in an Agile environment is to have ownership of an area, a system or similar. That enables fast feedback, quick decision making and also a sense of pride and responsibility for what people are working on.</p>

<p>However, when you have a big project, you can&#8217;t give it to just one team. You need many teams working together. You can split it up and get teams to work on the parts of the project affecting the code they own. This will though mean certain parts of the project go faster than others, and if teams are autonomous, who is really responsible for bringing all those pieces together? Also, imagine you are the project owner and need to have a rough handle on when things can actually be delivered, who is going to give you that? None of the individual teams know, everyone is Agile and cool and so everyone hates estimates.</p>

<p>The point made by three speakers at NDC London, <a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod">Dan North</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble">Jez Humble</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gojkoadzic">Gojko Adzic</a> came down to the need for the coordination piece across the teams. One thing Dan North (more or less) said is <em>&#8220;if your team is really fast and all the others are slow, the project is slow and your team haven&#8217;t achieved their goal&#8221;</em>. That was not the exact words he used but the sentiment came across.</p>

<p>Indeed we have some big projects at OpenTable and as we have properly embraced Agile in many ways, we still had some pain points in this exact area. We were getting to the same conclusions but since these talks we have had some more solid programme management and in the third cross-team meeting as a result, things starting taking shape. It really is an important piece of the jigsaw.</p>

<p>I would also recommend a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILP1pJAuT9c&amp;list=PLBMFXMTB7U74NdDghygvBaDcp67owVUUF&amp;feature=c4-overview-vl">DevDay talk</a> from Dariusz Dziuk on this and how Spotify make things scale. Slightly different content but a similar theme.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In years gone by, we were a traditional IT company. We had teams of developers and operations. They rarely mixed. Around nine months ago we started to really try and get these teams working together. We introduced a configuration management tool, <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet">Puppet</a>, into our ecosystem.</p>

<p>Configuration management is one of the steps of continuous delivery that developers often forget. They feel that systems are magically created for them to deploy their application to. I used to believe this. When I was focused on developing software, I never gave any thought as to the work our operations team had to do to keep the train on the track. So give some respect to your operations teams! We created a repository and started to experiment by configuring some of our applications using Puppet.</p>

<p>This was a major step for both sets of teams. The developers started being in charge of the configuration of their application. This meant that their application would guarantee to be configured the same in our CI environment as it was in production. We, as developers, would be more confident of our applications working as expected.</p>

<p>To contribute to the project, as an engineer, you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>fork the project</li>
<li>make the changes you require</li>
<li>test the changes in a Vagrant environment (already created with a Windows and Linux system)</li>
<li>send a PR (pull request)</li>
</ul>


<p>We have just merged our #847 pull request. The stats of the repository look as follows:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/puppet-adoption.png"></p>

<p>Our puppet repository has had contributions from over 40% of our engineering / operations teams. We use Puppet to manage our application servers, DHCP servers, provisioning systems and even our MS Sql Server continuous integration infrastructure. The adoption has been fantastic. We started by running our internal QA infrastructure and then scaled it out to our production infrastructure. We now manage 548 nodes (a combination of internal and production) via Puppet.</p>

<p>Using a project called <a href="www.fullybaked.co.uk/articles/getting-gource-running-on-osx">Gource</a>, one of our engineering leads, <a href="http://twitter.com/ryantomlinson">Ryan Tomlinson</a>, created a video of the repository vizualization. It&#8217;s just over two minutes long and shows the activity the repository has taken.</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/86201508 "></iframe></div>


<p>Each branch in the tree relates to a directory inside our repository. Green zaps are additions, orange are updates and red deletions. The important thing to take from the video is the evolution of the repository, the amount of changes and the number of people pushing those changes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very happy with our configuration management adoption. We are by no means at a point where everyone does it, but we are working towards that. I would like our contributors to rise to over 75% of our engineering / operations team by the end of 2014. Let&#8217;s see how that goes&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We allow all our UK based developers to have some time to explore new technologies, try out prototypes and clean-up things that escape the day-to-day process. Two days out of ten, seems a lot doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<h2>How we started</h2>

<p>We started doing our 20% time when we had two week sprints with a release each sprint. We actually had three days of testing, small bug fixing and signing things off. We didn&#8217;t like starting our new stories for the next sprint as our QAs got behind and never really caught up. We decided to use this time more for clean-up but also for prototyping or trying something out. We had read of other companies doing something similar so were excited to give it a go.</p>

<p>One of the first times we did this we actually decided we wanted to automate all the testing of one of our systems, so that our QAs weren&#8217;t bogged down for those three days. In our first 20% time, we got most of the team on board as it was painful watching, let alone doing manual testing and we wanted faster feedback on our changes.</p>

<p>We got a lot of the system in a state we could test it. We basically wrote a lot of a page object model and a few features to talk to it. The next 20% time it needed cleaning up, the next we had a lot under test. With a bit of work the three day test cycle was down to about one day. This would never have happened if we were trying in normal sprint time. Major win number one and something no business owner had had to wrestle against other priorities.</p>

<p>After this instance we have had numerous similar examples, albeit on a smaller scale, where each team has been able to try things out, with no consequence in the event of failure, and achieved great prototypes. Much of our new architecture has been tested out in these sessions, new technologies, new approaches, can people work together?</p>

<h2>Failures, not so bad after all</h2>

<p>Of course, we have had many failures, but maybe even that helps, we won&#8217;t waste our proper sprint time. Some people ask me about rules when I talk about this. I think the key for me is that the engineers are truly given freedom to explore. If on the face of things something they are doing is completely away from what you are doing then it might seem a bit strange.</p>

<p>But what if they are looking to try something new and would have left your company to do so? What if they think it might be a solution but don&#8217;t know how to say? What if they can use it in nine months on an urgent project? All these things can and have happened.</p>

<h2>Fear, as always, is detrimental</h2>

<p>Another rule, <em>no fear</em>,  applies in many situations of course. But unlike hackathons where you feel the need to present at the end, presenting should be through excitement of the creator, not demand of the manager.</p>

<h2>Better team as a result</h2>

<p>I have seen our whole UK engineering group get a lot stronger through our use of 20% time. We have also been more attractive in interviews and gets very positive responses when discussing our job openings; so many developers just want an opportunity to learn and apply new skills and will leave a job to do so.</p>

<p>I personally now have a child, attempting to try new skills and experiment at home is proving harder and harder. This 20% time becomes more important &ndash; as a team we are trying to really get to grips with the latest trends in the development community. I just don&#8217;t have anywhere near as much time in the evenings now, it is a way to stop a divide coming between your team, the ones with spare time and the ones without.</p>

<p>I recommend giving it some serious thought for your organisation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever been lucky enough to mentor someone who really got it? Maybe you&#8217;ve had the opposite experience and the session ended up being a failure for both of you?</p>

<p>We are fortunate enough to be in an industry that gives us the chance to coach others and have a direct influence on the learning of individuals around us. But how do we know when we&#8217;re doing it right, or more importantly what can we do when it starts to go wrong?</p>

<h2>Know your student, find their style</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with the science behind how we learn.</p>

<p>The first recognised attempt to identify different approaches individuals use in order to learn was David Kolb with the book &#8217;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Experiential-Learning-Experience-Source-Development/dp/0132952610">Experimental Learning</a>&#8217;. Kolb suggested that humans have a range of learning techniques available to us and that we tend to lean on one learning style above all others.</p>

<p>In recent times his research has proved to be inaccurate - yes people have different learning styles, yes they  show an emphasis in one particular style but Kolb&#8217;s definition of separate styles was confused.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles#Peter_Honey_and_Alan_Mumford.27s_model">Honey and Mumford and their 1999 adaptation on Kolb&#8217;s model</a>. They identified four distinct learning styles which have since grown to be the preferred assessment of human learning styles.</p>

<p>The important thing to remember is not all individuals can be pigeon-holed into one group. These characteristics are evident across all industries and teams; I can certainly see myself and others in this list. Can you?</p>

<p>Now we can silo and identify behaviour, we can look deeper into the flow of learning.</p>

<h2>Complete the circle</h2>

<p>Let me introduce you to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bernice-mccarthy/15/564/715">Bernice McCarthy</a>. Bernice has been in education for more than 30 years so it&#8217;s not surprising she has an insight into her field. During her time in education she spotted a pattern and designed a framework that increased the success rate of individual learning.</p>

<p>Research suggests that this framework (<a href="http://www.4mat.eu/">4MAT</a>) is proven to be successful as it follows the thought processes of individuals when they try to learn. It works by explaining not just the WHY? but also the WHAT?, the HOW? and the WHAT IF?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.chowamigo.co.uk/images/4mat.png" alt="image" /></p>

<ol>
<li><p>WHY? => Convey the meaning and purpose of the change in order to engage people. <strong>Engage the why</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>WHAT? => Once it&#8217;s made relevant provide facts, structure or theory to explain what is going to happen. <strong>Inform the what</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>HOW? => Focus on the problems and how best to solve them. <strong>Applying the how</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>WHAT IF? => Ask questions and experiment. What else, what&#8217;s next. <strong>Learn by doing</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So how is this helpful?</p>

<p>If we look at the the 4MAT framework and overlay the 4 learning styles from Honey and Mumford we can see some obvious similarites:</p>

<p>PRAGMATISTS = WHY?</p>

<p>ACTIVISTS = WHAT?</p>

<p>THEORISTS = HOW?</p>

<p>ACTIVISTS = WHAT IF?</p>

<p>This is really useful to know, by following the 4MAT framework you are reaching out to each learning style and increasing your chances of being successful in your role as a coach, mentor or teacher.</p>

<h2>Theory schmery, how does this work in practice?</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s easy enough for us to read this information and take it in, forget about it, move on.</p>

<p>But if we look at a real-world scenario, something that is relevant to our industry and is generally a tough problem to sell it&#8217;ll make it more tangible. In my world, that can be breaking apart a legacy application that has become too difficult to work with.</p>

<p><strong>WHY?</strong>
We have a monolithic website right now. The code is too complicated, has no obvious structure and is very tough to change. We need to be able to release solid code, fast.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT?</strong>
The fact is we are struggling to maintain this application and we can forget about adding new features. Even small updates are causing outages. As a result our site performance has degraded to unacceptable levels.</p>

<p><strong>HOW?</strong>
The initial thought from the team is to break the monolith into identifiable pieces of functionality. We will try to get each piece behind an API. We hope to abstract the front-end code away so it communicates to these new endpoints.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IF?</strong>
What if we refactor with the MVP pattern first and see where the duplication lies? Is there an argument to leave the non-urgent areas of the site until the appetite is there to attack them? We think REST APIs are the way to go, what are your thoughts?</p>

<h2>Do, there is no try</h2>

<p>Outlining and truly grasping these styles can really help push learning in your team further. Try reaching out to different learning styles and see how people respond.</p>

<p>Maybe you are pairing on a tricky feature, struggling to get your point across. Perhaps you have a tough decision that you need to sell to your team. Let&#8217;s say you are lucky enough to speak at a conference in front of hundreds of delegates - you could do a lot worse than to remember <strong>WHY?</strong>   <strong>WHAT?</strong> <strong>HOW? </strong> <strong>WHAT IF?</strong></p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/hubot_pug_me.png"></p>

<p>As a part of our 30% time a few of our team, <a href="https://twitter.com/ajroyle">@ajroyle</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stack72">@stack72</a> and I (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryantomlinson">@ryantomlinson</a>) decided to get together and look at <a href="http://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a> with <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/">Hipchat</a> integration. There are several weird and wonderful scripts that ship with Hubot (see above) but the core concept of driving tooling via chat is one that we see value in.</p>

<h2>What is Chatops?</h2>

<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnewland/chatops-at-github">Chatops</a> is a term coined by Github to describe their growing culture of “putting tools in the middle of the conversation”. But what does that exactly mean?</p>

<p>To move fast and maintain stability it’s important to have a culture of automation, measurement and sharing (<a href="http://www.opscode.com/blog/2010/07/16/what-devops-means-to-me/">CAMS</a>). Tooling plays a key role in doing so and as your devops toolkit grows with the team there is an inherent learning and maintenance overhead. <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> made a move to centralise the conversation by driving everything they do into chat. By building tools and executing commands in a chat room that can be automated by a bot, communication doesn’t become an afterthought to operational processes but is core to how you operate. If I want to deploy code, I type a command into chat. If I want to take a server offline, I type a command into chat. If I want to merge a git pull request into master, I type in a command into chat, and so on. Communication is baked in.</p>

<h2>What is Hubot?</h2>

<p>Hubot is a chat bot that sits in your chat room, listens for commands and executes them. It was written by Github in Coffeescript on Node.js and comes with a host of <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/tree/master/src/scripts">prewritten scripts</a> to get started with. Hubot also comes with a range of adaptors that allow it to plug-in to chat servers such as Campfire, IRC and Hipchat. We chose the latter.</p>

<h2>How do you get started?</h2>

<p>I won’t re-write the readme because the getting started section <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot/tree/master/docs">here</a> says it all. Using the node package manager it’s so easy to get up and running with <a href="https://github.com/blog/968-say-hello-to-hubot">Hubot</a>. So many other people have documented this process that I won’t attempt to rewrite their <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/writing-hubot-plugins-with-coffeescript/">good</a> <a href="https://github.com/blog/968-say-hello-to-hubot">posts</a>.</p>

<h2>How we want to use it and our first scripts</h2>

<p>Although the core scripts that shipped with Hubot are helpful…</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/hubot_beer_me.png"></p>

<p>…we started to focus on commands that would be most useful to how we work at <a href="http://www.toptable.co.uk/">toptable</a> and the tools and technologies that we employ. Specifically we got together and decided the following would be a useful starting point:</p>

<ul>
<li>Triggering TeamCity builds to ship to production</li>
<li>Displaying the status of a JIRA ticket, adding comments and changing their status</li>
<li>Checking London Underground tube lines for delays via Transport for London API</li>
<li>Querying the status of our APIs (internal and external)</li>
<li>Query ElasticSearch node and health cluster</li>
</ul>


<p>Within no time we had some useful scripts written:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/hubot_tube_status.png"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/hubot_jira.png"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/hubot_teamcity.png"></p>

<p>Immediately as we were developing these scripts we realised the potential of what else we could automate into Hubot and we will continue to do so. Some of which are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Github interaction</li>
<li>AWS interaction to see host health</li>
<li>Teamcity integration to trigger builds</li>
<li>Nagios interaction to trigger status checks</li>
<li>More JIRA integration to comment on tickets</li>
<li>Kibana integration to create dashboard URLs</li>
<li>AppDynamics interaction to query response times etc. (and more)</li>
</ul>


<p>Driving operations in chat has huge benefits for us. Collaboration, deployment and automation of common tasks can be done from anywhere, in the office (UK or US) or remotely for those that work from home. Hipchat has mobile support and their mobile apps are great. We hope it will improve on-call visibility, triaging of issues and resolving them without the need for VPN.</p>
