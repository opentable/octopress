    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>When is acceptance-only testing a good idea, and how can its problems be overcome?</em></p>

<p>In <a href="/blog/2014/04/16/look-ma-no-unit-tests">a recent post</a>, I espoused some of the benefits my team enjoyed by reducing our test-base to a single layer of acceptance tests, with no separate unit or integration tests. It caused <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/237fr1/look_ma_no_unit_tests/">some minor controversy</a>, which was not to be unexpected. At the time, I knew I had left out some details for brevity&rsquo;s sake. In this post—spurred on by some interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanGloyn/status/456756552092098561">questions</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/237fr1/look_ma_no_unit_tests/cgujuv7">commentary</a>—I&rsquo;d like to offer a more constructive view on the subject, and dig a little deeper into the nitty gritty of how we made it work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll also point out some other hidden benefits of moving to acceptance-only testing, and suggest synergistic practices that can help decide if this is the right approach for your project.</p>

<h2>Seams</h2>

<p>After-the-fact unit testing requires us to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEhu57pih5w">find the seams</a> along which code can be isolated and tested. Where those seams don&rsquo;t exist,  the temptation is to refactor code until they do, using patterns like <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">dependency injection</a>, and following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">SRP</a> and other <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">SOLID</a> patterns.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test-first unit testing</a> aka TDD naturally tends to maximise seams, and results in highly decoupled code with small, specific tests. TDD must result in 100% unit test coverage, if practiced according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-Driven_Development_by_Example">the gospel</a>. In other words, TDD results in the best kind of code for later <a href="http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring">modification without risk</a>, and the best tests for detailed, granular feedback. Unit tests also tend to run very quickly, sometimes fast enough to <a href="http://misko.hevery.com/2009/05/07/configure-your-ide-to-run-your-tests-automatically/">run every time you hit &ldquo;Save&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Acceptance testing has far fewer seams available.</strong> Typically only one: the application boundary. Yes: <em>Your tests must invoke the entire application each time they are run.</em> Thus running acceptance tests is potentially very slow for even moderately sized projects with few dependencies—let alone large ones with many. Another problem is that, when an acceptance test fails, the failure could be at <em>any</em> layer in the stack. You immediately lose the pinpoint specificity afforded by unit tests.</p>

<p>Why, then, is it sometimes a good idea to forgo unit- in favour of acceptance-tests?</p>

<p>As we will see, the first issue, performance, can be mitigated. The second, granularity, is more difficult to overcome. But sometimes <em>that might be okay.</em></p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>In most cases I have seen, acceptance tests are <em>really</em> slow. In some cases, there might be nothing you can do, but usually there is. Front-end automation suites using <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> are temporally incorrigible, but they can be parallelised. Complex transactional pieces might be irreducible, but they can be helped with mock data. No matter which box your code is in, there is probably an escape route. Following are some of the techniques we used to overcome performance bottlenecks in our acceptance test suite&hellip;</p>

<h3>Sandbox Data</h3>

<p><em>This is probably a topic that deserves its own post, but I&rsquo;ll try to give a high-level treatment here.</em>
In our project, we took on the overhead of providing mock &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; data. For our consumers this was a required feature anyway, so implementing it began early in the project, well before we <a href="/blog/2014/04/16/look-ma-no-unit-tests">deleted all the unit tests</a>. It turned out this was an important enabler in moving to acceptance-only, since it allowed us to run tests much faster by <em>sometimes</em> circumventing data access.</p>

<p>Since this project was written in C# using strict TDD, our data layer already had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computer_science)#Software_interfaces_in_object-oriented_languages">an interface</a> for each data source. In the <em>unit</em> tests this allowed us to easily stub out the data. We reused the same interfaces to build up our sandbox, with dependency injection at runtime to choose between real and mock data. (I like to call this a &lsquo;pseudoseam&rsquo; in that it allows us to isolate data access at runtime, just like an ordinary seam allows you to isolate classes and methods in test.)</p>

<p><em>Sandbox data is hard to implement. A lot of the effort that would have gone into unit tests and their maintenance was instead pumped into writing good, wholesome, fake data for the sandbox.</em> However, sandbox data, unlike unit tests, solves three problems at once:</p>

<ul>
<li>It lets your <em>consumers</em> test in a predictable way without making real transactions;</li>
<li>It enables you to record specific data conditions from The Real World™, increasing your understanding of that data;</li>
<li>It lets you test internal business logic independently from real data, fast.</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Snip!</em> I went into too much detail on sandbox data here, saving that for a future post.</p>

<h3>Loosen Isolation</h3>

<p>Isolation between test runs is really important. If the order you run tests in can ever alter the results, then you have shared state, and you can no longer trust that your tests are testing the same thing each time they are run.</p>

<p>Usually, in unit testing, we rely on the test runner to respect directives in code that enforce isolation in this way. In NUnit with C# we use attributes for <a href="http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=setup&amp;r=2.2.10">set-up</a> and <a href="http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=teardown&amp;r=2.2.10">tear-down</a>, for example. We usually throw away the entire object graph before each test. <em>Sometimes before each assertion.</em> For acceptance testing, where spinning up your test subject tends to take longer, it can be helpful to bend the rules somewhat.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, each test run would begin on a new, freshly installed OS, thus eliminating any possibility of differing test results due to environmental issues—the system clock and network state notwithstanding. For unit testing we rarely if ever take this extremist approach. More usual is to rely on the test runner to enforce &ldquo;similar enough&rdquo; initial conditions each time a test is run–commonly relying on the developer to write this set-up and tear-down code correctly.</p>

<p>In acceptance testing it can be very beneficial for performance to loosen this one step further and re-use the same application instance (process) between test runs. Sandboxed data, especially if it is immutable, can help enormously to avoid the pitfalls of shared state. When running your acceptance tests against real data, where shared state is a real concern, you may discover interesting bugs that would otherwise have gone unnoticed if you were using only unit tests. <strong>Upon the discovery of issues with real data, you must implement the same failing condition in your sandbox data so that you don&rsquo;t accidentally introduce regressions later.</strong></p>

<p>The way we initially achieved this in our acceptance tests was by using the <code>TestFixtureSetup</code> attribute from NUnit to invoke the application, and run it to a point where it had generated an interesting result. Then, each &lsquo;test&rsquo; is in fact a single assertion on the state of the world at that point. Like this:</p>

<p>```csharp
[TestFixture]
public class my_acceptance_tests
{</p>

<pre><code>[TestFixtureSetUp]
public void do_stuff()
{
    _result = InvokeTheApplicationsWithSomeGivenParams();
}
[Test]
public void it_is_cool()
{
    Assert.That(_result.Coolness, Is.GreaterThan(1337));
}
[Test]
public void it_has_2_bananas()
{
    Assert.That(_result.Bananas, Is.EqualTo(2));
}
.
.
.
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>We eventually refined this to use constructors to set up the initial state, and did some other not-necessarily-normal things to coax our acceptance tests into a reasonably elegant suite. More on this in an upcoming post on sandbox data.</p>

<h2>Granularity</h2>

<p>Granularity, in this case, refers to the level of detail revealed by a failing test. When a <em>unit</em> test fails, if it&rsquo;s written correctly, you should immediately know which method in which class went wrong. Often, the call stack in the exception message will tell you exactly which line of code was at fault. You can immediately jump to the offending code.</p>

<p>With acceptance tests, when something goes wrong, it could be anywhere in your program. Any of the tens, hundreds, thousands, or even millions of lines of code in your program could be at fault. This is clearly less than ideal, however there are ways to mitigate the pain:</p>

<h3>Minimise Code, Maximise Seams</h3>

<p>Clearly, the fewer lines of code in your app, the easier it will be to hunt down obscure test failures. However some problems are too big to be solved with few lines of code. What then to do? One answer, which we are beginning to explore in a new project, may be to write many small programs, each of which solves only a small part of the problem domain. This approach is known as <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">microservices</a>, and certainly has its own complexities in threading together many small pieces at OS or network level. However, a microservices architecture has additional potential benefits tangential to its affinity with acceptance-only testing. I&rsquo;m planning a blog post on this subject soon, once we have more data.</p>

<h3>Debugfu</h3>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t really a way to make your tests more granular, but it can help mitigate the problems of low granularity in acceptance tests. If the test won&rsquo;t tell you which line of code went wrong, attach a debugger to find out! If you&rsquo;re using Visual Studio, you are blessed with a best-of-breed debugger. Use it, trace through the execution and try to spot what went wrong. Use bookmarks and breakpoints to index your code. Does one area of code cause problems time and time again? There is probably something wrong with it, see if it can be rewritten more clearly. Users of  IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or a myriad other IDEs, will also have access to usable debuggers.</p>

<h3>Sandbox Data (Again)</h3>

<p>Sandbox data allows you to run your tests against very specific data conditions. Often your code will have a different execution path depending on data, and this is really valuable knowledge when trying to nail down the cause of a test failure. Sandbox data, that can be selected by your tests, will improve the percieved granularity of such, by limiting the potential execution paths.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>I mentioned a few of the benefits of moving to acceptance-only testing in my last post. However, a few more have come to light since then which are worth mentioning.</p>

<h3>Acceptance Tests Are Language-Agnostic</h3>

<p>After writing v1 of our API, and acceptance-testing the living daylights out of it, we realised that we were still probably maintaining too much code, this time in the application itself. We decided to port the whole thing to JavaScript using Node to see what it would be like.</p>

<p>It worked, and <em>we didn&rsquo;t have to touch a single test,</em> even though those tests were written in C#, and the application was in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Just imagine the overhead of porting hundreds of unit tests over to a different language, along with the application. If that had been a requirement of our experiment, it would not have happened, and we would not have learned what we did. <em>(In the end we did keep using the C# implementation in production, but the speedy rewrite was still a valuable learning aid.)</em></p>

<h3>Acceptance Tests Behave Exactly Like Your Users</h3>

<p>When an acceptance-level test passes, you can be confident that a whole user journey using your application is working correctly. That&rsquo;s a huge win. When one fails, you can be pretty confident that something important to your users is not working properly and needs attention. Also, very valuable knowledge. This contrasts somewhat with unit-level tests that might tell you something internal is awry with your application, but its real impact to consumers will still often be unknown. Should you fix it? If there are multiple failures, which are the most important? Unit tests will rarely answer these questions for you.</p>

<p>Of course, you will fix it, or else be unable to confidently release your software–but surely, at times, you will be fixing something that does not matter, or is no longer relevant to your consumers. Unit tests in this way can encourage code rot, making it very difficult to unpick dependencies that are no longer needed. With acceptance tests, you only need to unpick the dependencies in your application, not also in the tests.</p>

<h2>Synergy</h2>

<p>Much of this is new to me, and certainly isn&rsquo;t without contention. However, the problems with acceptance-only testing, and specifically the solutions to those problems, indicate certain synergistic practices that may improve its viability:</p>

<h3>Thin Layers</h3>

<p>The project we first tried moving to acceptance-only testing on was a very thin layer–a facade over a collection of internal services. It had minimal business logic, and thus few potential execution paths. This certainly allowed us to keep the number of acceptance tests lower than might be expected for a large, complex application, that might branch off into numerous modes of operation. Of course one should probably try to minimise the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a> of a code-base anyway, for one&rsquo;s own sanity.</p>

<h3>Statelessness</h3>

<p>If your system maintains a lot of state, acceptance testing can be much harder. This is because you will likely have to set-up much of that state for each test, increasing both developer effort and execution time. Both of which are bad. However, my new favourite thing, immutable sandbox data, may well be your friend in this case.</p>

<h3>Microservices</h3>

<p>We have only just begun experimenting with microservices ourselves, however I think it stands to reason that if each application is small overall, then the number of test cases for each will be small as well. This means the whole suite will run faster, and give you more granular feedback. I differentiate microservices from &lsquo;thin layers&rsquo; in that a microservice may well do data access, input parsing, validation, HTTP handling, and a bit of business logic–but over a very narrow domain–i.e. a thin vertical. A thin layer, on the other hand will perform only one kind of function–e.g. HTTP handling–but across multiple facets of the system. If thin layers are the lines of latitude, then microservices can be sections of the lines of longitude.</p>

<h2>Too Short; Read Also</h2>

<p>I hope this article has been a little more useful than the previous one. I have tried to explain more specifically what we actually did, from end-to-end, and how we overcame problems along the way. However, I&rsquo;ve really only scratched the surface. I will hopefully get the chance flesh out some of the ideas here in the coming months. In the mean time, there are plenty of <a href="http://www.shino.de/2012/07/02/atdd-by-example/">books</a> and <a href="http://jonkruger.com/blog/2012/02/20/when-acceptance-tests-are-better-than-unit-tests/">blog posts</a> on the subject of acceptance testing. In addition, Martin Fowler has writen <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">a great primer on microservices</a> that&rsquo;s really got me thinking about their utility alongside acceptance-only testing and sandbox data.</p>

    <id>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/04/16/look-ma-no-unit-tests</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I&rsquo;ve written a <a href="/blog/2014/05/19/acceptance-now">follow-up to this post</a> with a bit more detail into how we made acceptance-only testing work in practice.</em></p>

<p>At OpenTable we strive to deliver change as quickly and correctly as possible. To do this effectively we are always looking for <a href="/blog/2014/02/28/api-benchmark/">new</a> <a href="/blog/2013/08/16/grunt-plus-vagrant-equals-acceptance-test-heaven/">tools</a> <a href="/blog/2014/04/07/upgrading-puppet-with-puppet/">and</a> <a href="/blog/2014/02/10/the-adoption-of-configuration-management/">methods</a> that allow us, the developers, to respond quickly and accurately to changing requirements and environments.</p>

<p>There are a number of practices that we already make use of, helping us to be the most effective team I&rsquo;ve ever worked in:</p>

<ul>
<li>We operate in small teams who each own <em>most</em> of their own vertical.</li>
<li>We use continuous delivery to ship code to production within minutes.</li>
<li>We have a high degree of high-quality test coverage.</li>
<li>We are getting better and better at monitoring All The Things.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2013/11/22/beginning-a-journey-to-chatops-with-hubot/">We use Chatops</a>, so communication is central to our work, and keeps remote workers/teams in the loop.</li>
</ul>


<p>All of the above are truly empowering for the dev team, and are conducive to an amazingly stress-free working environment. However, these practices only address the infrastructure, culture, and ceremony surrounding our work. What if there was something else? Something about the way we write the code itself, that could increase our velocity yet further, without compromising our integrity&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>There are a number of practices that we already make use of, helping us to be the most effective team I&rsquo;ve ever worked in&hellip; What if there was something else?</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, on a recent project, we found one such way: <em><em>we decided to delete all of the unit and integration tests</em></em>.</p>

<p><em>What?! Are we quite mad?</em> You may be thinking&hellip; Well, it took me a little time to get used to this idea as well, but read on and you&rsquo;ll see that it was actually the most sane thing we could have possibly done  .</p>

<h2>Survival of the testedest</h2>

<p>In the beginning, the project had 100% unit test coverage, there were no external dependencies, and the world was Good.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, a tall shadow appeared in the glorious unit-tested sunset. External dependencies had arrived. Like good little developers we added integration tests. It hurt, our codebase grew, we had occasional false-failures, but we were travelling the path well trodden. We had evaded the First Menace, and surrounded ourselves with heavy armour, we were safe. Things seemed to be Good.</p>

<p><em>Meanwhile&hellip;</em></p>

<p>We realised that some of the things that would be important to our consumers were still not covered by our tests. Things like actual HTTP responses, serialisation, and the like. These are things that don&rsquo;t always need to be tested explicitly, but since this was a third-party-developer-facing system, we really wanted to be sure that the interface worked exactly as we wanted, HTTP headers, character encoding, date formatting, the lot.</p>

<p>So, playing the role of our consumers, we engineered high-level acceptance tests, behaving byte-for-byte as we expected our customers to do.</p>

<p>Now, with the triple-action protection of three layers of tests, we felt our project was the most minty-fresh piece of haute engineering we had ever laid keyboards on.</p>

<p>We were wrong.</p>

<h2>Tests, tests, tests, duplication.</h2>

<p>Up to this point, we had operated in a near-vacuum. That was fine, we had been working quickly to implement a sub-set of an existing and well-used API, so we knew which were the most important features that needed porting. We continued, largely happy with our creation, for some time.</p>

<p><em>Then, gazing up from the receding tide of the third trimester were the hungry eyes of the Second Menace. Our users were upon us!</em></p>

<p>Our early adopters were great, giving us a lot of helpful feedback and helping us shape the API into a genuinely usable v1. However, responding to this change required a greater degree of flexibility in the code than we had required up to this point. Our triple-chocolate-crunch of pithy tests was starting to really slow us down, and rot our teeth. The main reason for this: duplication.</p>

<p>We had tried from the start to avoid any duplication in our tests, but this was all but impossible to achieve. You just can&rsquo;t test an API call end-to-end in an acceptance-test style, without inadvertently testing all of the underlying logic for that call. Code which was already covered by unit tests, and often integration tests as well. Therefore each move we made came with the burden of updating multiple tests. Often materially very similar tests, but written to test a different layer of the same cake. We were between an immovable monolith and a very heavy boulder&mdash;and had a hoarde of features we still wanted to smash, who were freely bounding over the mountain tops, and out of reach.</p>

<p>It was time to cut ourselves free.</p>

<h2>Ripping off the plaster</h2>

<p>The idea that we might not need all these layers of tests was first mooted by fellow OpenTable engineer Arnold Zokas. My initial reaction was one of slight incredulity. Delete all those tests that we&rsquo;ve so carefully caressed and cajoled into a thing of beauty?! Strip off the armour?! I wasn&rsquo;t immediately convinced. However, the pain of implementing new features was starting to burn, so I was interested.</p>

<blockquote><p>I wasn&rsquo;t immediately convinced.</p></blockquote>

<p>We talked about it&mdash;what was necessary about the unit tests? What was their real worth? We had to test many of those things from the outside-in anyway, with the acceptance tests, so why test them twice? The logic started to stack up. I was convinced this was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Take a deep breath. <em>RIP!</em> Aah, there, done.</p>

<p>There was a little bleeding, some gaps in our acceptance tests that had to be filled, some complex set-up logic from the integration tests that had to be ported to work with the acceptance tests. A few days' worth of cleanup and patching in the background, and&hellip; tentatively&hellip; we were done.</p>

<p>For me at least, this was a bold move. But it shouldn&rsquo;t have seemed so, we knew all of our endpoints were acceptance-tested, including every supported API call. My primary worry was how we were going to nail down the exact cause of bugs with no code-level testing. This turned out to be nowhere near as bad as I expected.</p>

<blockquote><p>We knew all of our endpoints were acceptance-tested, including every supported API call.</p></blockquote>

<h2>What just happened?</h2>

<p>I like to visualise this as if we were building <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Arch">a giant arch</a>. At first, you build a temporary structure with scaffolding (the unit and integration tests). As time goes on you construct a hardened permanent structure (the software). On top of the software, you layer your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_health_monitoring">structural integrity monitors</a> (acceptance tests). Eventually, there is no need for the scaffolding any more; the structure is self-supporting, and future modifications can rely on this&mdash;time to punch out the middle!</p>

<p><em>Of course, there are other considerations, like logging, monitoring, and providing sandbox data, which all contributed to making this feasable&mdash;but that&rsquo;s for another post.</em></p>

<h2>Was it worth it?</h2>

<p>Unequivocally, yes. Since making this decision, we have been unhindered by our tests, and they are back to being a much loved part of the project. We have had no problems that would have been caught by unit tests, and we can still do TDD with our acceptance tests. In addition, I think removing the crutch of unit tests may have improved our discipline somewhat: <em>it keeps us thinking in the context of the end-user at all times, so we never spend time working on a feature that isn&rsquo;t directly useful to our consumers.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>It keeps us thinking in the context of the end-user at all times, so we never spend time working on a feature that isn&rsquo;t directly useful to our consumers.</p></blockquote>

<h2>YMWMCV</h2>

<p>Of course, every project is unique (just like every other project), so <em>your mileage will most certainly vary.</em> We were working on a stateless facade over a small but crucial subset of the business&mdash;making reservations. For relatively small, stateless projects, this approach has worked brilliantly. However, when things do go wrong at development time, they could be at any layer in the stack, and you often need to attach a debugger to find out what happened. This is less than ideal, but in our case was a very cost-effective compromise.</p>

<p>The upshot, for me at least, is that you shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to shirk convention when the project demands it. By really analysing what each part of your project is doing, you can cut the cruft, helping you move faster <em>without</em> breaking stuff.</p>

    <updated>2013-07-24T14:32:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2013/07/24/one-gun-many-enemies</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent some time, re-investigating Javascript. After a few months of intensive TDD and SOLID training at OpenTable I was curious how those principles apply in a slightly different environment. Guess what, they do not differ that much&hellip; I planned to write about all this sometime in the future after gaining more experience from real battles ahead, however <a href="http://watirmelon.com/2013/02/09/why-i-dont-like-Jasmine/">Watirmelon post</a> invited me to attack this subject immediately.</p>

<p>I went through the available testing frameworks for Javascript and decided on Jasmine. Why? Mainly because of its BDD syntax which is fashionable this season. The second reason is that it has really cool documentation. Finally, the basic set up of just running an HTML file in a browser got me up and running fast.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the basics &ndash; what I expect from different types of tests and how Jasmine fits into those requirements:</p>

<h2>Unit Testing</h2>

<h3>Advice from senior craftsman</h3>

<ul>
<li>Shoot them one by one
(structure your code so that it is easier to maintain)</li>
<li>Be sure you kill with every shot
(verify small bits of code to nail down issues)</li>
<li>Kill them all
(verify edge cases)</li>
<li>Kill them quick
(provide fast feedback on issues)</li>
<li>Choose a fast shooting gun &ndash; the faster you shoot, the more enemies you will kill
(unit tests must be blazing fast)</li>
<li>Choose the most reliable gun &ndash; if it is stuck then you are dead
(when unit tests are brittle you will stop depending on them)</li>
<li>Your gun needs to be light enough to carry everywhere
(unit tests are your gun, so you must be able to run them all locally)</li>
</ul>


<p>Jasmine works great for all those aims, as it is really fast and it allows you to stub both objects and DOM elements (especially combined with a Jasmine-jQuery plugin). Keep in mind that Unit Testing is useful only if you either write new code or refactor old code. Do not ever try to write Unit Tests for existing code which you don&rsquo;t intend to refactor. It&rsquo;s like shooting the dead. You simply cannot kill them with another bullet.</p>

<h2>Integration Testing</h2>

<h3>Advice from senior craftsman</h3>

<ul>
<li>Beware of the hidden sniper
(test against external dependencies like files, databases, network services)</li>
<li>You are part of your squad
(verify that components of the application work well together)</li>
<li>Observe the environment
(try to use depenedencies as close to the real problem as possible e.g. example file, database with test data, test version of an external service)</li>
<li>Point in the right direction
(do not try to test your stack top-down, instead concentrate on interfaces and adapters that you could not test in unit tests)</li>
</ul>


<p>Integration tests will naturally be harder to quickly setup &ndash; they might break due to configuration problems or inaccessible external services. That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t want to have that many of them. Still, you want to know that all your problems are due to your partner changing protocol. Once again nothing stops us from using Jasmine here.</p>

<p>Jasmine just executes your tests, so the tests that point towards external services, send example files to your code etc. will all be a breeze to implement with Jasmine.</p>

<h2>Acceptance Testing</h2>

<h3>Aims</h3>

<ul>
<li>Confirm you are fighting the right war
(show specification to your product owner/manager/client)</li>
<li>Keep clean supply routes
(test the functionality of your app with full set up and all dependencies)</li>
<li>Find hidden mines
(test your application in all environments to which you deploy)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Advice from senior craftsman</h3>

<ul>
<li>Speak in their language
(use a tool which allows writing tests in natural language such as Cucumber or SpecFlow)</li>
<li>Take your time
(those tests will be slower, so accept that you will not always run them locally and that you will not run them every minute)</li>
<li>Spend your resources wisely
(acceptance tests are naturally much more brittle then other types of tests, so try to keep their number reasonably small)</li>
</ul>


<p>This is where I would not recommend Jasmine, simply because it doesn&rsquo;t fit this job. Its syntax is based on programming language, so it is harder to read by non-engineers. Jasmine allows you to execute events and call your code. However, your users will be most likely be using a browser to interact with your code, so it is much better to use a tool that also uses a browser to test your web page.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I find Jasmine extremely well suited for unit and integration testing. I wouldn&rsquo;t use it for acceptance tests as there are quite few better tools for that job. And I guess that is the issue that Alister Scott has with Jasmine on his blog &ndash; he tried to use it for acceptance testing. In that case I wouldn&rsquo;t choose Jasmine either. On the other hand I don&rsquo;t like using a screwdriver to hammer a nail.</p>

<h2>Post Scriptum (on DOM dependency)</h2>

<p>Alister also complains about integration issues between his server-side code and client-side code. His experience is that changes to IDs and classes in MVC applications result in failing Javascript. The issue is serious and shows one important mistake, which is hardcoding dependencies. IDs and class names are configurable details and Javascript code should be agnostic of them. To illustrate let&rsquo;s look at a simple test case from my pet-project:</p>

<pre><code>describe("GameController", function(){
  describe("During Initialize", function() {
    var view;
    var subject;

    beforeEach(function() {    
        setFixtures("&lt;div id="myid"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;");
        subject = new GameView();

        subject.CreateFabricInDiv("#myid");
    });

    it("creates fabric in div", function(){
        expect($("#myid")).not.toBeEmpty();
    });

    it("holds pointer to canvas", function(){
        expect(subject._canvas).not.toBe(undefined);
    });
 }); 
</code></pre>

<p>Do you see how &ldquo;#myid&rdquo; parameter is passed into the method call? We moved the configuration detail out from the Javascript code, which in my opinion it is the simplest solution to Alister&rsquo;s problem.</p>

<p>If code is designed in such a way that IDs/class names are not embedded all around the codebase you can figure out quite few nice ways to keep them consistent between Javascript and server-side code.</p>

<p>It also helps with code re-usability as you can use the same code on two separate pages with differing IDs!</p>
