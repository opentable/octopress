  <div class="entry-content"><p>Three OpenTable heroes took to Norway last week to attend NDC Oslo. For two of us it was our first major conference and for one, Paul Stack, he had to speak.</p>

<p>Personally, as my first large, multi-discipline conference, I didn&rsquo;t really know what to expect. Being away from the team for three days in a foreign country with major project work going on at the same time was a bit uncomfortable. I was worried that the time and expense needed to be justified. That fear went away after the first night in the bar!</p>

<p>The sessions were great, many things I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to investigate were covered, things like Functional Programming, the latest JavaScript frameworks and tooling. There were also sessions covering things I am more involved with, Agile Process, SOA &amp; Rest, Team Structure and Hiring.</p>

<p>There are other posts around about the individual sessions but I am now much more enthusiastic about functional programming particularly how we could use it and getting back into front end development (even if just in my own time).</p>

<p>The main thing I enjoyed and learnt though is meeting the other delegates. I think staying away from home makes this much more prevalent, something to consider for other conferences. Meeting people at all levels or experience and especially the speakers, most of whom are very generous with their time and ideas, teaches you the most. I probably learnt more over the shuffle board of The Dubliner Pub than reading blog post online in a year (that may be a stretch, but I did learn I was by far the best player on the night).</p>

<p>Watching a colleague speak was also interesting, when you work with a buffoon, however passionate and hard working, to see people actually interested in what he has to say is an eye opener. It makes you realise what you are doing and all its challenges are a step forwards and one to keep pursuing. It also makes you think, &ldquo;if he can do it, I must be able to, what knowledge should I share?&rdquo;. What to share is the hard bit.</p>

<p>My final point is how often I should try to get to these; one a year for sure, any more than that? I need to think that through.</p>

<p>Thanks to the organisers of the conference for a well organised, varied and enjoyable time. And if you have project work on, the wifi was excellent so you need never be too far away from the rest of the team, just do it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In late 2012, our development team started to move towards our systems being much more automated. Long gone are the days of developers creating runbooks in Word and giving them to our operations team to use to set up our production servers.</p>

<p>When building our webservers on Windows, in order to install / activate Windows features, this was the general set of instructions that was needed to be followed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Click Start Button</li>
<li>Click on Control Panel</li>
<li>Click on Programs</li>
<li>Click on Turn Windows features on or off</li>
</ul>


<p>This would present a screen as follows:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/windowsfeature.png"></p>

<p>You would need to find the correct features to enable and check the box, press OK and then wait for the features to be installed.</p>

<p>When Microsoft introduced Windows Server 2008 and PowerShell 2.0, they also introducted the module &lsquo;ServerManager&rsquo;. This is a module that allows us to interact, with PowerShell, Windows Features using a range of cmdlets:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get-WindowsFeature</li>
<li>Add-WindowsFeature</li>
<li>Remove-WindowsFeature</li>
</ul>


<p>This meant that instead of creating runbooks in Word, our developers could create automation scripts that would take a base Windows Server 2008 server and enable all the Windows Features needed to run our applications. This allowed our operations team to move much faster in configuring our servers.</p>

<p>To turn on the ASP.NET Application Development features in Windows, we would run the following script from PowerShell:</p>

<pre><code>Import-Module ServerManager
Add-WindowsFeature Web-Asp-Net
</code></pre>

<p>By knowing what Windows Features we needed to install on our servers, we were able to create the following script:</p>

<pre><code>function enable_net_3_5_features()
{
    Add-WindowsFeature NET-HTTP-Activation
    Add-WindowsFeature NET-Win-CFAC
    Add-WindowsFeature NET-Non-HTTP-Activ
    Add-WindowsFeature AS-MSMQ-Activation
}

function enable_iis_common_http_features()
{
    Add-WindowsFeature Web-Static-Content
    Add-WindowsFeature Web-Http-Errors
    Add-WindowsFeature Web-Default-Doc
}

function enable_iis_application_development_features()
{
    Add-WindowsFeature Web-Asp-Net
    Add-WindowsFeature Web-Net-Ext
    Add-WindowsFeature Web-ISAPI-Ext
    Add-WindowsFeature Web-ISAPI-Filter
}

function enable_iis_health_and_diagnostics_features()
{
    Add-WindowsFeature Web-Http-Logging
    Add-WindowsFeature Web-Request-Monitor
}

function enable_iis_security_features()
{
    Add-WindowsFeature Web-Filtering
}

function enable_iis_performance_features()
{
    Add-WindowsFeature Web-Stat-Compression
    Add-WindowsFeature Web-Dyn-Compression
}

function enable_iis_management_tools()
{
    Add-WindowsFeature Web-Mgmt-Tools
    Add-WindowsFeature Web-Mgmt-Console
}


Write-Host('Starting Application Server Setup')

Import-Module ServerManager
enable_net_3_5_features
enable_iis_common_http_features
enable_iis_application_development_features
enable_iis_health_and_diagnostics_features
enable_iis_security_features
enable_iis_performance_features
enable_iis_management_tools 

Write-Host('Application Server Setup complete')
</code></pre>

<p>Running the script, meant that we could enable features much faster than we could enable them via the GUI. Notice how we have grouped how we enable Windows Features into the same groupings found in the &lsquo;Turn Windows features on or off&rsquo; menu. For a full list of the names of the features that can be turned on or off, please refer to this <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732757.aspx">technet article</a></p>

<p>You can download a <a href="https://gist.github.com/opentable-devops/5886831">gist</a> of this script if you want to use it. Please note that the license that this script is available under can be read from our <a href="https://github.com/opentable/licensing/blob/master/LICENSE">github repository</a>. We hope that the script helps you as much as it helped us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>History</h2>

<p>With OpenTable having engineering teams spread across multiple offices it&rsquo;s important for us to maintain open email dialogue about new products us or our teams have created, new tools we&rsquo;ve discovered or problem solving approaches that have helped us achieve our goals.  Recently in one of these emails Aish introduced the team to a new open source ruby implementation of reverse geocode lookup for latitude and longitude he&rsquo;d written called <a href="https://github.com/aishfenton/local-geocoder">local-geocoder</a>.  With an interest in understanding how this worked, to learn a bit of ruby, to make this project accessible to .net developers and just to see how long it would take I decided to port it to C# and .net.</p>

<h2>How reverse geocoding works</h2>

<p>Latitude and longitude geographical coordinates are great but 37.819548,-122.479046 doesn&rsquo;t really mean much to me. Knowing this is in the San Francisco bay area is much more useful interpretation.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where reverse geocoding comes in.  Normally geocoding tries to locate geographical coordinates from other data like postal (zip) codes or street level addresses.  Reverse geocoding does the opposite and can, given enough lookup data, be very precise.</p>

<p>There are a number of online reverse geocoding providers, like Google, who can perform this for you however there are normally usage limits or costs for using them.  To add to this the latency of these service can slow your logic down.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if this could be done locally at high speed and in memory.</p>

<h2>Using nLocalGeocoder</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s really easy to use, just new up a Geocoder and you&rsquo;re off&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>var geocoder = new Geocoder();
var result = geocoder.ReverseGeocode(-122.479046M, 37.819548M);
</code></pre>

<p>The result variable now holds an instance of the Result struct.  This type has the following properties:&ndash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Country <em>&ndash; Id and Name of the country</em></li>
</ul>


<p>and for USA only (because that&rsquo;s all the data in our <a href="http://www.geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> data)</p>

<ul>
<li>AdministrativeArea1 <em>&ndash; Id and Name of the state</em></li>
<li>AdministrativeArea2 <em>&ndash; Id and Name of the county</em></li>
</ul>


<p>The code is available for all to use and is available on our <a href="https://github.com/opentable/nLocalGeocoder">github repo</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s as simple as that really!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>First some background</h2>

<p>We recently switched from writing automated acceptance from Cucumber to SpecFlow&hellip; this is no slight on Cucumber it&rsquo;s just that we had a lot of C# developers who wanted to get closer to writing acceptance tests. Worth adding that SpecFlow has also come a long way as a .Net port of Cucumber and is pretty much like for like now.</p>

<h2>Why should I bother with SpecRun?</h2>

<p>Initially we ran our entire unit, integration and acceptance tests via nUnit. Pretty much industry standard but we felt nUnit wasn&rsquo;t really a good tool to run acceptance tests &ndash; yes it&rsquo;ll do the job but we were looking for better performance, quicker failure feedback and more comprehensive reporting. If you want details on SpecRun vs. nUnit Gasper has a <a href="http://gasparnagy.com/2011/09/specrun-because-integration-tests-are-not-unit-tests/">great blog post</a>.</p>

<p><salespitch>SpecRun itself is free to use although there is a random delay when running acceptance locally, setting up SpecRun on a CI environment is totally free and does not include the same delay. Definitely worth trying out and you can purchase a licence later if you like what it offers.</salespitch></p>

<h2>Installing SpecRun</h2>

<p>If you are already using SpecFlow with nUnit the migration to SpecRun is really simple &ndash; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ge90BWeI0">this video</a> shows you how to setup the test runner but I found myself having to watch it too many times. This post is an attempt at recording the steps should we roll out SpecRun for another project.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re running Visual Studio and are familiar with Nuget packages. I&rsquo;ll break it down so I don&rsquo;t miss anything:</p>

<ol>
<li>In VS, select your Acceptance test project and get the Nuget package down for SpecRun: <code>install-package SpecRun</code>.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll notice Nuget automatically adds configuration to your app.config so it&rsquo;s safe to remove the nUnit provider setting (this is to enable you to pick and choose your test runner but we prefer to only use SpecRun).</li>
<li>Open the Default.srprofile file and we normally delete any commented settings here.</li>
<li>Still inside Default.srprofile add the properties for projectName and projectId. The projectName is what you see in VS the projectId can be found by opening the acceptance .proj file and taking the projectGuid.</li>
<li>Setup the execution properties &ndash; this really depends on what you want to get out of running the tool &ndash; what retry count you want, whether to run on multiple threads, etc. Here are the values we normally use:</li>
</ol>


<p><code>&lt;Execution retryFor="None" stopAfterFailures="100" testThreadCount="1" testSchedulingMode="Sequential" apartmentState="STA"/&gt;</code></p>

<ol>
<li>We did tweak the SpecRun .cmd file used to run acceptance via command line &ndash; <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8835075/runacceptance.cmd">copy this file</a> to your project root, you may need to tweak some names and paths.</li>
</ol>


<p>Once you&rsquo;ve gone through those steps you should be able to browse to your project root, type <strong>runacceptance.cmd tag_to_run</strong> and it&rsquo;ll run your acceptance tests tagged <strong>@tag_to_run</strong>  (NOTE: you don&rsquo;t need to specify the @ symbol).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi, my name is Paul Harrington and I&#8217;d like to welcome you to the <a href="http://www.opentable.co.uk">OpenTable UK</a> technology blog &ndash; a place where we&#8217;d like to share our passions and introduce you to a whole new world of fabulous dining and amazing technology.</p>




<h2>Who are we?</h2>




<p><p>First and foremost we&rsquo;re into food. And restaurants. And delighting our diners with wonderful dining experiences. And if you want to hear more from us about <i>these</i> passions then pay a visit to the <a href="http://blog.opentable.co.uk">OpenTable UK blog</a> or the <a href="http://press.opentable.co.uk">OpenTable UK Press Centre</a> and follow <a href="https://twitter.com/opentableuk">@OpenTableUK</a> on Twitter &ndash; because on this blog you&rsquo;re only going to hear about our love of technology and all the cool stuff we do with it!</p>

<p><p>But first some introduction is needed. I am the Senior Director of Engineering and have worked at OpenTable for four years. My principal goal is to create environments where awesome teams of Engineers can build awesome software! The specific journey we&rsquo;ve been through to achieve this is a topic for another day but there is one key message that is worth sharing. When I first arrived, I had a dream that I shared with the team &ndash; <b>to create the best engineering team in the UK</b>. It was an ambitious target and we don&rsquo;t really have an effective way of testing whether we&rsquo;ve been successful in that goal. But the consistent belief in achieving that vision was enough to at least make it feel true and it has led to some spectacular results, some of which you will read about on here.</p></p>

<p><h2>What do we do?</h2></p>

<p><h3>We build great software.</h3></p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re passionate about high quality code and we use cutting-edge technologies and techniques to achieve it. The core of our system is built in .Net so we have a lot of expertise in this area but we&rsquo;re not limited to a single language. We like to explore new languages and look to apply it wherever it is relevant. We&rsquo;re meticulous in the code we write but pragmatic when necessary to deliver the best results for the business. Legacy code is in trouble as we look for every opportunity to get rid of it, but that in itself is never the goal &ndash; the goal is to build great software that delivers value to our customers.</p></p>

<p><h3>We believe in testing.</h3></p>

<p><p>We test everything we produce to within an inch of its life. We employ TDD and BDD at a unit level and we create suites of integration tests and business readable acceptance tests. We build performance tests, load tests and smoke tests and have our systems continuously monitored so we can spot when issues occur. And we do this all within the Engineering team, there is no &ldquo;throwing over the wall&rdquo; to a separate QA team that does all the testing &ndash; the teams of Engineers themselves are responsible for the quality of our systems.</p></p>

<p><h3>We move fast.</h3></p>

<p><p>We automate everything &ndash; testing, builds, deployments and monitoring. We believe in continuous delivery and we use it to get feedback on our systems as quickly as we can. Either to fix issues or to adapt to our customers&#8217; needs. And we combine that ethos with a DevOps culture, working with our Operations team to write scripts that build servers and applications within minutes rather than days.</p></p>

<p><h2>How do we do it?</h2></p>

<p><h3>We believe in the ethos of Agile.</h3></p>

<p><p>But not some restrictive version of Agile read from a book or delivered from a course. We believe in the ideas of trying something, seeing the results and iterating over that until we come up with better and better solutions. And we apply this methodology to everything we do &ndash; our code, our development process, our team structure and our performance management. We&rsquo;re never happy with the status quo.</p></p>

<p><h3>We believe in sharing.</h3></p>

<p><p>You can never know it all. You will spend your whole life learning new lessons without even scratching the surface of what there actually is out there to know. But that&rsquo;s not a reason not to try and so we believe in sharing our experiences with each other. We read books, run vision groups, hold brown-bag sessions and attend training, always in the pursuit of self-improvement and sharing. And you&rsquo;ll see our name come up more and more at events and conferences as we start sharing our thoughts with the wider world.</p></p>

<p><h2>And finally</h2></p>

<p><p>This is starting to sound like a sales pitch and I don&rsquo;t want to do a <a href="http://www.theuncool.com/films/jerry-maguire/jerrys-mission-statement/">Jerry Maguire</a> so I&rsquo;ll sign off now. But we&rsquo;re not finished, in fact we&rsquo;ve only just started. We&rsquo;re still on a journey and we want to share our experiences with you along the way. I don&rsquo;t know when we&rsquo;ll get to the end (probably never) but I think the most fun is to be had as we go anyway.</p></p>

<p><p>I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed this introduction and we&rsquo;re always on the look-out for exceptional people so if you think you&rsquo;ve got what it takes to be a part of this phenomenal team then let us know on Twitter &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/opentabletechuk">@OpenTableTechUK</a>.</p></p>

<p><p>Paul Harrington</p></p>
