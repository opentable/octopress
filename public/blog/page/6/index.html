  <div class="entry-content"><h2>First some background</h2>

<p>We recently switched from writing automated acceptance from Cucumber to SpecFlow&hellip; this is no slight on Cucumber it&rsquo;s just that we had a lot of C# developers who wanted to get closer to writing acceptance tests. Worth adding that SpecFlow has also come a long way as a .Net port of Cucumber and is pretty much like for like now.</p>

<h2>Why should I bother with SpecRun?</h2>

<p>Initially we ran our entire unit, integration and acceptance tests via nUnit. Pretty much industry standard but we felt nUnit wasn&rsquo;t really a good tool to run acceptance tests &ndash; yes it&rsquo;ll do the job but we were looking for better performance, quicker failure feedback and more comprehensive reporting. If you want details on SpecRun vs. nUnit Gasper has a <a href="http://gasparnagy.com/2011/09/specrun-because-integration-tests-are-not-unit-tests/">great blog post</a>.</p>

<p><salespitch>SpecRun itself is free to use although there is a random delay when running acceptance locally, setting up SpecRun on a CI environment is totally free and does not include the same delay. Definitely worth trying out and you can purchase a licence later if you like what it offers.</salespitch></p>

<h2>Installing SpecRun</h2>

<p>If you are already using SpecFlow with nUnit the migration to SpecRun is really simple &ndash; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ge90BWeI0">this video</a> shows you how to setup the test runner but I found myself having to watch it too many times. This post is an attempt at recording the steps should we roll out SpecRun for another project.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re running Visual Studio and are familiar with Nuget packages. I&rsquo;ll break it down so I don&rsquo;t miss anything:</p>

<ol>
<li>In VS, select your Acceptance test project and get the Nuget package down for SpecRun: <code>install-package SpecRun</code>.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll notice Nuget automatically adds configuration to your app.config so it&rsquo;s safe to remove the nUnit provider setting (this is to enable you to pick and choose your test runner but we prefer to only use SpecRun).</li>
<li>Open the Default.srprofile file and we normally delete any commented settings here.</li>
<li>Still inside Default.srprofile add the properties for projectName and projectId. The projectName is what you see in VS the projectId can be found by opening the acceptance .proj file and taking the projectGuid.</li>
<li>Setup the execution properties &ndash; this really depends on what you want to get out of running the tool &ndash; what retry count you want, whether to run on multiple threads, etc. Here are the values we normally use:</li>
</ol>


<p><code>&lt;Execution retryFor="None" stopAfterFailures="100" testThreadCount="1" testSchedulingMode="Sequential" apartmentState="STA"/&gt;</code></p>

<ol>
<li>We did tweak the SpecRun .cmd file used to run acceptance via command line &ndash; <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8835075/runacceptance.cmd">copy this file</a> to your project root, you may need to tweak some names and paths.</li>
</ol>


<p>Once you&rsquo;ve gone through those steps you should be able to browse to your project root, type <strong>runacceptance.cmd tag_to_run</strong> and it&rsquo;ll run your acceptance tests tagged <strong>@tag_to_run</strong>  (NOTE: you don&rsquo;t need to specify the @ symbol).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi, my name is Paul Harrington and I&#8217;d like to welcome you to the <a href="http://www.opentable.co.uk">OpenTable UK</a> technology blog &ndash; a place where we&#8217;d like to share our passions and introduce you to a whole new world of fabulous dining and amazing technology.</p>




<h2>Who are we?</h2>




<p><p>First and foremost we&rsquo;re into food. And restaurants. And delighting our diners with wonderful dining experiences. And if you want to hear more from us about <i>these</i> passions then pay a visit to the <a href="http://blog.opentable.co.uk">OpenTable UK blog</a> or the <a href="http://press.opentable.co.uk">OpenTable UK Press Centre</a> and follow <a href="https://twitter.com/opentableuk">@OpenTableUK</a> on Twitter &ndash; because on this blog you&rsquo;re only going to hear about our love of technology and all the cool stuff we do with it!</p>

<p><p>But first some introduction is needed. I am the Senior Director of Engineering and have worked at OpenTable for four years. My principal goal is to create environments where awesome teams of Engineers can build awesome software! The specific journey we&rsquo;ve been through to achieve this is a topic for another day but there is one key message that is worth sharing. When I first arrived, I had a dream that I shared with the team &ndash; <b>to create the best engineering team in the UK</b>. It was an ambitious target and we don&rsquo;t really have an effective way of testing whether we&rsquo;ve been successful in that goal. But the consistent belief in achieving that vision was enough to at least make it feel true and it has led to some spectacular results, some of which you will read about on here.</p></p>

<p><h2>What do we do?</h2></p>

<p><h3>We build great software.</h3></p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;re passionate about high quality code and we use cutting-edge technologies and techniques to achieve it. The core of our system is built in .Net so we have a lot of expertise in this area but we&rsquo;re not limited to a single language. We like to explore new languages and look to apply it wherever it is relevant. We&rsquo;re meticulous in the code we write but pragmatic when necessary to deliver the best results for the business. Legacy code is in trouble as we look for every opportunity to get rid of it, but that in itself is never the goal &ndash; the goal is to build great software that delivers value to our customers.</p></p>

<p><h3>We believe in testing.</h3></p>

<p><p>We test everything we produce to within an inch of its life. We employ TDD and BDD at a unit level and we create suites of integration tests and business readable acceptance tests. We build performance tests, load tests and smoke tests and have our systems continuously monitored so we can spot when issues occur. And we do this all within the Engineering team, there is no &ldquo;throwing over the wall&rdquo; to a separate QA team that does all the testing &ndash; the teams of Engineers themselves are responsible for the quality of our systems.</p></p>

<p><h3>We move fast.</h3></p>

<p><p>We automate everything &ndash; testing, builds, deployments and monitoring. We believe in continuous delivery and we use it to get feedback on our systems as quickly as we can. Either to fix issues or to adapt to our customers&#8217; needs. And we combine that ethos with a DevOps culture, working with our Operations team to write scripts that build servers and applications within minutes rather than days.</p></p>

<p><h2>How do we do it?</h2></p>

<p><h3>We believe in the ethos of Agile.</h3></p>

<p><p>But not some restrictive version of Agile read from a book or delivered from a course. We believe in the ideas of trying something, seeing the results and iterating over that until we come up with better and better solutions. And we apply this methodology to everything we do &ndash; our code, our development process, our team structure and our performance management. We&rsquo;re never happy with the status quo.</p></p>

<p><h3>We believe in sharing.</h3></p>

<p><p>You can never know it all. You will spend your whole life learning new lessons without even scratching the surface of what there actually is out there to know. But that&rsquo;s not a reason not to try and so we believe in sharing our experiences with each other. We read books, run vision groups, hold brown-bag sessions and attend training, always in the pursuit of self-improvement and sharing. And you&rsquo;ll see our name come up more and more at events and conferences as we start sharing our thoughts with the wider world.</p></p>

<p><h2>And finally</h2></p>

<p><p>This is starting to sound like a sales pitch and I don&rsquo;t want to do a <a href="http://www.theuncool.com/films/jerry-maguire/jerrys-mission-statement/">Jerry Maguire</a> so I&rsquo;ll sign off now. But we&rsquo;re not finished, in fact we&rsquo;ve only just started. We&rsquo;re still on a journey and we want to share our experiences with you along the way. I don&rsquo;t know when we&rsquo;ll get to the end (probably never) but I think the most fun is to be had as we go anyway.</p></p>

<p><p>I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed this introduction and we&rsquo;re always on the look-out for exceptional people so if you think you&rsquo;ve got what it takes to be a part of this phenomenal team then let us know on Twitter &ndash; <a href="https://twitter.com/opentabletechuk">@OpenTableTechUK</a>.</p></p>
