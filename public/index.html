  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of one of our recent <a href="http://tech.toptable.co.uk/blog/2014/04/04/forgefriday-our-commitment-to-the-puppet-forge/">ForgeFriday</a> efforts we released a new module puppetversion with the purpose of managing the installation and upgrade of puppet in a platform agnostic way.</p>

<p>This should be a very straightforward task to complete because this is one of the core resources that puppet manages - the upgrading of packages. With that in mind, putting <code>package { ‘puppet’: ensure =&gt; $version }</code> in one of our base profiles would be all that was needed but alas it was not. In this blog I want to take you through the history, the bugs, the platforms and the edge-cases that make performing an in-place upgrade of puppet a more complex task that it ought to be.</p>

<h2>Debian</h2>

<p>Like many, Ubuntu is our Debian derivative of choice for much of our newer production infrastructure. Debian, has the apt package management system and PuppetLabs provide the required deb packages as well as hosting their own apt repository to point our systems to. The main point of package management systems is it that they take care of the dependency hell and the awkward upgrade paths all from within the confines of the package itself, and that is what happens with the PuppetLabs packages - great.</p>

<p>The problem that we had in some of our systems was that they had been built without the PuppetLabs apt repository. This means that they picked up a slightly older version of the puppet packages from the main Ubuntu distribution repositories and didn’t have access to the newer versions of the puppet packages. Ok, so we solved that with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>  exec { 'rm_duplicate_puppet_source':
    path    =&gt; '/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin',
    command =&gt; 'sed -i \'s:deb\ http\:\/\/apt.puppetlabs.com\/ precise main::\' /etc/apt/sources.list',
    onlyif  =&gt; 'grep \'deb http://apt.puppetlabs.com/ precise main\' /etc/apt/sources.list',
  }

  apt::source { 'puppetlabs':
    location    =&gt; 'http://apt.puppetlabs.com',
    repos       =&gt; 'main dependencies',
    key         =&gt; '4BD6EC30',
    key_content =&gt; template('puppetversion/puppetlabs.gpg'),
    require     =&gt; Exec['rm_duplicate_puppet_source']
  }
</code></pre>

<p>We&#8217;re making use of the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apt">puppetlabs/apt</a> module here. This removes the old reference and adding in the new apt source. Then we just add the package and ensure the version and we’re upgrading. Perfect.</p>

<h2>RedHat</h2>

<p>Same problem different OS family - this time we had some older CentOS machines that needed fixing. Thankfully there is also a module <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/stahnma/puppetlabs_yum">stahnma/puppetlabs_yum</a> for the yum repositories. Add that in, add the package resource and start upgrading. Phew! This seems like it’s getting easier.</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>Many of you will be following the work of OpenTable closely because of our work with puppet on windows. We have a pretty large windows infrastructure, with a wide range of client and server versions deployed ranging from 2012 R2 all the way back to the historic times of 2003. Windows also has it’s own package format, the msi, and PuppetLabs also provides all versions of puppet packaged as msi files.</p>

<p>This is where it gets a little tricky. The big problem we had was that the windows provider, prior to 3.4.0 was not versionable (<a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/21133">issues/21133</a>) that means that <code>package { ‘puppet’: ensure =&gt; installed }</code> would work but <code>package { ‘puppet’: ensure =&gt; $version }</code> would not - the exact thing we were trying to do! The only way to resolve that problem is to uninstall and reinstall the package with the correct version.</p>

<p>Now there are a lot of problems with the uninstall/reinstall approach. Firstly we had to script the process because windows only allows one installer to run at any one time meaning that you had to wait for the uninstall to finish before that subsequent install takes place. Secondly we have to deal with puppet runs and make sure that when the upgrade script runs that we wait for any active puppet runs to complete before trying to uninstall puppet. Next we have to trigger our script using a scheduled task.</p>

<p>Our experience with scheduled tasks has been painful. We attempted using the <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#scheduledtask">scheduled_task</a> resource type but soon realised that this wasn’t going to work for us. The resource type is good if you want to create a task to run at a fixed point in time but there is no way to provide a relative time e.g. “in the next 5 mins from now”. Also on occasion the task would not run or would silently fail - this was almost certainly due to another puppet issue we discovered (<a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1368">PUP-1368</a>). Without being able to use the scheduled task resource we were again back in the land of Powershell using a script to create the scheduled task that would call our upgrade script.</p>

<p>So if you&#8217;re keeping up we now have something like this:</p>

<p>Puppet -> calls script to create scheduled task -> scheduled task calls upgrade script -> upgrade script upgrade puppet and triggers next Puppet run -> Puppet</p>

<p>Nice little cycle there, but it works.</p>

<p>One final issue worth mentioning is that for Windows 2003 servers you’ll need to actually have Powershell installed. Luckily, we also have a module for that <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/dcharleston/powershell">dcharleston/powershell</a></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Well we’ve discussed some of the pain points, and we’ve discussed them in detail with PuppetLabs themselves. The advice here is to upgrade to puppet 3.4.3 as soon as you can as many of these issues are resolved in that version. For those of you not on that version yet then we have you covered with our puppetversion module.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One afternoon I got asked to write a new Puppet module to manage local users on our Linux boxes. Not a contrived example but a real-world need as we begin to move our infrastructure from Windows to Linux. Managing users is one of those tasks that is at the core of the Puppet ecosystem and I thought this would be pretty easy as I had done this sort of thing many times before. What added to the complexity was that we needed to support Ubuntu, Centos and FreeBSD machines that we had in our stack and we wanted to make it something that was open source and on the Forge - so lots of testing was required.</p>

<p>This was not the first module that I had written for the Forge but it was the first that I had written since PuppetLabs had introduced their new acceptance testing framework <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker">Beaker</a> and so I wanted to spend some time getting the module working with this new tool.</p>

<h2>Beaker</h2>

<p>The purpose of Beaker is to allow you to write acceptance tests for your modules, that is to write some manifests that use your module and test them out on a virtual machine. Some of you may remember <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/rspec-system-puppet">rspec-system-puppet</a> was previously used to accomplish this, well PuppetLabs has since deprecated that in favour of Beaker but the premise is very much the same.</p>

<p>Using rspec-puppet for unit testing your manifests really only goes so far. If you&#8217;re just using the standard Puppet resources then it pretty safe to assume that it does what it says on the tin (I mean PuppetLabs really test their stuff!) but as soon as you start doing things that are a little more complex, using exec statements, custom facts, custom functions or targeting multiple operating systems then you&#8217;re really going to want to make sure that once the catalogs compile that they are doing what they are meant to be doing and this is where your acceptance test suite will come in.</p>

<p>With Beaker you can spin up a virtual machine, install modules, apply a manifest and then test what really happened.</p>

<p>Beaker works with many different hypervisor technologies but most people will be using <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> so that is what I will cover here.</p>

<h3>Configuring Beaker</h3>

<p>The first thing in configuring your existing project to use Beaker is to add “beaker” and “beaker_rspec” to you Gemfile. You&#8217;re then going to want to create a new spec_helper file called spec_helper_acceptence.rb that should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>require 'beaker-rspec/spec_helper'
require 'beaker-rspec/helpers/serverspec'

hosts.each do |host|
  install_puppet
end

UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = ['Suse','windows','AIX','Solaris']

RSpec.configure do |c|
  proj_root = File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..'))

  c.formatter = :documentation

  # Configure all nodes in nodeset
  c.before :suite do
    puppet_module_install(:source =&gt; proj_root, :module_name =&gt; 'homes')
    hosts.each do |host|
      on host, puppet('module','install','puppetlabs-stdlib'), { :acceptable_exit_codes =&gt; [0,1] }
      on host, puppet('module', 'install', 'opentable-altlib'), { :acceptable_exit_codes =&gt; [0,1] }
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This contains quite a bit of new setup that you won’t have seen before. Beaker contains lots of useful helper methods for doing all the things that you&#8217;re going to want to do when running Puppet against a virtual machine; install Puppet (so your boxes don’t have to have it pre-baked), installing local modules and installing modules from the Forge. We also specify the platforms that we don’t support - we’ll make use of this later.</p>

<p>The next step is to define some machines that we want to set against. Beaker calls these nodesets because while in most cases you’ll only want to test one host machine at a time, Beaker does support testing multi-node configurations for more complex scenarios. Looking at the homes project your directory structure will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>puppet-homes
  manifests
  spec
    acceptance
      nodesets
        centos-64-x64.yml
        default.yml
        ubuntu-server-12042-x64.yml
      homes_spec.rb 
    defines
    fixtures
    spec_helper.rb
    spec_helper_acceptance.rb
  tests 
</code></pre>

<p>A nodeset is simply a yaml file that specifies the box name, where it downloads it from, its platform and the hypervisor you are using. A example from the homes module below:</p>

<pre><code>HOSTS:
  ubuntu-server-12042-x64:
  roles:
    - master
  platform: ubuntu-12.04-amd64
  box : ubuntu-server-12042-x64-vbox4210-nocm
  box_url : http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/ubuntu-server-12042-x64-vbox4210-nocm.box
  hypervisor : vagrant
CONFIG:
  log_level: verbose
  type: git
</code></pre>

<p>More detail about how to configure these yaml files can be found on the Beaker wiki, <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/wiki/Creating-A-Test-Environment">Creating A Test Environment</a></p>

<p>In the above example I am using Vagrant boxes provided by PuppetLabs but there are a few other sources to discover already pre-built boxes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/">http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/">http://www.vagrantbox.es/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vagrantcloud.com">https://vagrantcloud.com</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Writing tests in Beaker</h3>

<p>So now that we have our environment set up let’s look at actually writing some tests. Here is an example from the homes project:</p>

<pre><code>require ‘spec_helper_acceptance'

describe 'homes defintion', :unless =&gt; UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORMS.include?(fact('osfamily')) do

  context 'valid user parameter’ do

    it 'should work with no errors’ do
      pp = &lt;&lt;-EOS
        $myuser = {
        'testuser' =&gt; { 'shell' =&gt; '/bin/bash' }
      }

      homes { 'testuser':
        user =&gt; $myuser
      }
      EOS

      apply_manifest(pp, :catch_failures =&gt; true)
      expect(apply_manifest(pp, :catch_failures =&gt; true).exit_code).to be_zero
   end

   describe user('testuser') do
     it { should exist }
   end

   describe file('/home/testuser') do
     it { should be_directory }
   end
 end

end
</code></pre>

<p>In this case we are writing a test to make sure that when our module runs, it creates the user and its home directory as it expects. Using the UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORMS that we defined earlier we can also skip groups of tests if they are not supported on the current node.</p>

<p>The idea here is that we define a manifest (using Heredoc - but please don’t make them too long!) and then we want to apply that manifest to the node. Beaker provides a nice helper methods that: apply_manifest. In our case we run it once, which will cause the changes and then we run it a second time with the scope of a test to check for idempotency. We can then make use of Beaker’s resource based helpers to actually test the functionality on the node itself. Their many helper methods will allow you to do almost everything that you need to do, either for setup purposes or for actually testing the node:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/wiki/The-Beaker-DSL-API">The-Beaker-DSL-API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/blob/master/lib/beaker/dsl/helpers.rb">beaker/dsl/helpers.rb</a></li>
</ul>


<p>It’s actually worth noting that Beaker makes heavy use of <a href="https://github.com/serverspec/serverspec">serverspec</a> which you should go and take a look at.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>So now you know a little about testing Beaker with Puppet go forth and test all your modules against everything that you expect your users to be running it on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Those of you that read this blog on a regular basis will be aware that here at OpenTable we take our commitment to Open Source very seriously. As part of the infrastructure team at OpenTable we are begining a process of being open-first. That means that everything we write will be open-sourced unless it contains a significant amount of internal information but we will architect to limit this.</p>

<p>As part of that commitment we are trying to release all our Puppet configuration. The key to maintaining any good habit is to do little and often and with that in mind we wanted to let you know about ForgeFriday.</p>

<p>Every Friday we will be releasing our Puppet code onto the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable">PuppetLabs Forge</a> (until we run out of modules). That means all our Windows modules, all our forks, our experiments, our custom facts and functions - anything and everything will start rolling out on Fridays.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just forge and forget either, we will continue to support all of our modules and those that use them. We will blog about some of the bigger, more important ones and continue to engage with the community as much as possible. If you&#8217;re using our modules (even if you have no issues) then let us know - we&#8217;d love to hear from you.</p>

<p>In the meantime go and check out what we have already released:</p>

<p><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/windowsfeature">opentable/windowsfeature</a> - Module that will turn Windows features on or off<br/>
<a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/iis_rewrite">opentable/iis_rewrite</a> - Module that will install the IIS Rewrite 2.0 Module on Windows <br/>
<a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/remaster">opentable/remaster</a> - Module for managing the remaster of agent nodes <br/>
<a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/puppetversion">opentable/puppetversion</a> - Module for managing the installation and upgrade of Puppet<br/>
<a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/altlib">opentable/altlib</a> - Module providing some additional useful functions <br/></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I18n is often a painful afterthought when serving content from a http-api. It can be taken for granted and tacked on using nasty query string values. But thankfully HTTP provides us with a solid gold opportunity. If you can look past the mire of content negotiation you can see the nuggets that lie inside.</p>

<p>The accept-language header is used by most browsers and allows websites to serve content in a language that the user can (hopefully) understand. When we expose content from an api (in most of our use cases, at least), this content eventually ends up in front of a human (in some shape or form). Having our service-service communication serve localised resources can be invaluable because it frees the clients from having to think about i18n of the resources being served from our api.</p>

<p>It is a simple part of the HTTP specification and is widely used and supported.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>GET /product/123
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Language: en-US</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The accept-language header is specifically designed to allow the server to provide a representation of the resource which approximates something the client can understand.</p>

<p>The really useful bit comes from the quality value.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>GET /product/123
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This header asks the service to provide en-US, and if it&#8217;s unavailable then fall back to <strong>any</strong> english representation. The quality value (<code>q=0.8</code>) is a decimal value between 0 and 1 which indicates order of preference when specifying multiple languages. The server should pick the <strong>first</strong> available match. If there are multiple matches with the same quality value, then the server can pick any. If the client wants to specify some fierce preferences then they can crank out something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>GET /product/123
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Language: fr-CA,fr-FR;q=0.8,fr;q=0.6,en-US;q=0.4,en;q=0.2,*;q=0.1</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you decipher this it&#8217;s pretty simple, you can see the quality headers giving the order in which the languages are preferred. What it does is give the client fantastic flexibility. For service-service communication you might have a use-case which will <em>never</em> serve a representation that doesn&#8217;t match the request, or you might need to <em>always</em> provide some representation (i.e. for cases where some content is always better than none).</p>

<p>The accept-language header gives you that flexibility. In my opinon, if your http-api&#8217;s are serving content that <em>can</em> be internationalised, the server should always support this type of behaviour because it can shift the control from the server to the client. It allows the server&#8217;s behaviour to be incredibly explicit and the clients get all that lovely flexibility.</p>

<p><strong>What happens when there is no matching representation?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the specification is (intentionally) vague. In other words, it is up to the server to decide. I myself always prefer to be explicit. Thankfully the HTTP specification provides for just such an eventuality.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html">HTTP 406 Not Acceptable</a> <em>&#8220;The resource identified by the request is only capable of generating response entities which have content characteristics not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>The 406 response <em>should</em> contain a list of characteristics which the resource does support. In this case, a list of available languages. The specification does allow the server to automatically select a representation to return, however in my opinion, the server should be explicit, rather than implicit.</p>

<p>If the client has a use case where it <em>always</em> requires some sort of response (i.e. where any content is better than no content), then the client can append a wildcard to the end of the accept-language header, which will instruct the server to fall back to <em>any</em> language, in the event that there are none matching.</p>

<p><strong>Parsing the Accept-Language header</strong></p>

<p>I wrote a little npm module to help us in <a href="https://github.com/andyroyle/accept-language-parser">parsing the accept-language header</a>. Once you get past the (somewhat hairy) regex, it&#8217;s a simple little bit of code. (Disclaimer, I&#8217;m not a regex god, so there are a couple of little bugs in it).</p>

<p>Parsing an accept-language string such as <code>en-US,en;q=0.8</code> gives an object looking like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>];</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Output is always sorted in quality order from highest -> lowest. as per the http spec, omitting the quality value implies 1.0.</p>

<p>We can pass this around our application and use it to select the representation which best matches the client&#8217;s request.</p>

<p><strong>Using it</strong></p>

<p>We use <a href="http://hapijs.com">hapi.js</a> for some of our api&#8217;s (and I&#8217;m very much in love), we use this module in a pre-requisite handler in our route:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>server.route({
</span><span class='line'>  method: "GET",
</span><span class='line'>  path: "/v5/restaurants/{id}",
</span><span class='line'>  config: {
</span><span class='line'>    pre: [
</span><span class='line'>      {
</span><span class='line'>        method: function(req, next){
</span><span class='line'>          next(alparser.parse(req.raw.req.headers["accept-language"] || ""));
</span><span class='line'>        },
</span><span class='line'>        assign: "language",
</span><span class='line'>        mode: "parallel"
</span><span class='line'>      }
</span><span class='line'>    ],
</span><span class='line'>    handler: function(req, reply){
</span><span class='line'>        ...
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>});</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For those of you that don&#8217;t know, the prerequisites run before the handler, and assign their values to the request object. You can now get hold of the parsed language object here:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>req.pre.language</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Content-Negotiation is hard</strong></p>

<p>Yes, it is. But suck it up. In my opinion the benefits outweigh the costs. Besides, the Accept-Language header is part of the HTTP specification and is well understood. If you have doubts, start small, and always try to be <em>explicit</em> rather than implicit.</p>

<p><strong>Gotchas</strong></p>

<p>Caching (both client-side and intermediate) can be picky. By default, most caches won&#8217;t respect the header content (i.e. the resource is cached by url only). You can get around this by using vary-headers:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>GET /product/123
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.8
</span><span class='line'>Vary: Accept-Language</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This instructs the cache that the response will vary with the value of Accept-Language, so when this changes it should be cached as a separate resource. Vary headers <strong>should</strong> be applied by the client to the request, however the server can apply them to the response if necessary.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="/blog/2014/03/19/performance-testing-our-search-api/">my last post</a> about performance testing I wrote about how we decided to do it in production as the ultimate test of success. Performance testing in production is enough to make some operations guys have a panic attack and a few odd looks were dished my way when I raised it on behalf of the team.</p>

<h2>Why not have a dedicated environment?</h2>

<p>If you can have a dedicated environment that you can build to be EXACTLY the same as where you are going to really need the performance (i.e. your production environment most likely, but possibly on a client machine) then do it in a dedicated, duplicated environment. Alternatively if there is no way you can use the production environment or your model means that everything will scale exactly like production, then a duplicate environment might work.</p>

<p>For us, we had too many dependencies, mocking these out wasn&#8217;t really satisfactory and frankly, as a business where we are quiet at night, it is easy to use the production environment at these times. We use configuration management and virtual machines, much of what should help build a replica environment, but we also have machines in restaurants around the globe. That is not easy to replicate and not worth the effort.</p>

<h2>Even if you can have a duplicated environment should you?</h2>

<p>We felt in the search team that we just wouldn&#8217;t uncover a broken server (that can affect performance) or we wouldn&#8217;t see that we had a problem with interactions with these services (we have now got to serialisation as our bottleneck, maybe we would have missed that).</p>

<p>We just didn&#8217;t trust that a duplicated environment would actually help us in this case. If you want to test a new idea as a prototype then the duplicate will probably work, even if just at first, we were trying to improve our actual environment.</p>

<h2>Is testing in production right?</h2>

<p>There is no &#8216;right&#8217; answer here, plenty of people test in a duplicate environment and then monitor in production. I think this is probably a valid approach and in a lot of use cases this would be fine for us too.</p>

<p>Can you micro-optimise in a huge production system?  Probably not, so use a scaled down duplicate for that or even a local environment such as one created using Vagrant. Hopefully with enough micro-optimisations you will eventually see these in a larger environment.</p>

<h2>Is it a free lunch?</h2>

<p>Testing in production is not a free lunch. Even simple things like system logging will cost as you will be logging to production data centres, probably with backup costs etc. Do you need to code-in safeguards? Yes, and you will need to watch this running from your desk. When you are not watching it will be hard to be sure you will not cause production issues. We can use our regional environment that means we are testing during our day, that region&#8217;s night, other companies might see you having to work in your timezone&#8217;s evening &ndash; not fun.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>Whilst, on the face of it, testing in production seems crazy, with all things considered we found it the easiest, most reliable and frankly most reassuring environment in which to test.</p>

<time datetime="2014-03-19T15:53:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 19<span>th</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was midnight on the Friday before Christmas, my seven-week old child was tucked up asleep and I was pretty chilled. All was calm and it was time for bed. Two minutes later I had a phone call, followed by a series of Nagios email alerts, and a need to put my work hat on quickly. The search API was having trouble; as the manager of the team who developed it, I was not looking forward to this. We were having a real slowdown at one of our busiest times of the year &ndash; this was going to be fun.</p>

<p>Once the dust settled and we were back up and running we realised we needed to do a better job of performance testing and actually solve any performance issues. We <em>had</em> done some performance testing but clearly not the right kind.</p>

<h2>What had gone wrong?</h2>

<p>We were indexing our data too frequently, and under load it started to take a long time. We created a race condition where multiple indexing operations started happening. As each operation assumed the previous one had either failed or finished a vicious circle occurred making the situation worse and worse.</p>

<p>The simple fix was just to index the data less often or not at all if another operation was running, however we wanted to get to the bottom of why we slowed down under load which exposed this race condition, improve that speed and understand what is the maximum load the system can take.</p>

<h2>Getting a benchmark</h2>

<p>In order to know if we were actually making improvements we needed to be able to recreate load and see the impact. In order to do this and truly appreciate how it was going we needed to use our live environment &ndash; the only environment I felt we could truly understand. My next post will explain why we felt this was the best environment for the job.</p>

<p>With search and availability it is actually quite hard to use response times as a benchmark and the name of this exercise was really to cope with greater load. Response times are still nice to improve though so we were tracking them, but not using them as our main benchmark.</p>

<h2>Some perspective on our problem domain</h2>

<p>We do not have a large index, in the tens of thousands of restaurants rather than millions of tweets for example. We have to merge in table availability (the fantastic thing about the OpenTable system) to the more static restaurant information. We also have large page sizes, needing to get up to 2,500 results out of one Elastic Search request. This proved to be relevant.</p>

<p>We also have an autocomplete search endpoint served out of the same infrastructure. That was not heavy in terms of resource usage but we still noted it slowed down when peak load was happening.</p>

<h2>Initial ideas to investigate</h2>

<p>We brainstormed a few things to investigate and assess as potential performance improvements. As we were still relatively new to Elastic Search (ES), a lot of these were related to the configuration of ES itself.</p>

<ul>
<li>Improved sharding strategy (we were using the default)</li>
<li>Check we were <a href="http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/Elasticsearch-Filter-And-Query-td4027675.html">filtering before querying</a></li>
<li>Check the <a href="http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/Performance-of-term-query-with-sorting-td4032901.html">sorting was efficient</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-optimize.html">Optimise the index</a> as part of the indexing process</li>
<li><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-optimize.html">Slow log</a> checking</li>
<li>Check how we were using the <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-source-field.html">source</a> in the index</li>
<li>Warm-up the index after it is built</li>
<li>Gzip between API boxes and ES</li>
<li>Check connection pool is a singleton, internal detail</li>
<li>Delete old indexes more rigorously (we have a new index each release)</li>
<li>Check <a href="http://grokbase.com/t/gg/elasticsearch/13bezebw1p/garbage-collector-issues">garbage collection</a> on ES boxes</li>
<li>Check <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/logstash-users/gfTTbRABk1M">swappiness</a> settings on ES boxes</li>
<li>Split different search types to different hardware</li>
</ul>


<h2>Now, we learned, we were a bit stupid.</h2>

<p>Once we worked through a few things, our main findings showed that we had made some rookie errors.</p>

<p>We had a sharding policy that is great for large indexes but we only needed one shard replicated on each ES server in the cluster. Changing that helped reduce the load across servers as each server could do our queries entirely.</p>

<p>Through Elastic HQ (<a href="http://www.elastichq.org/">the useful plugin to ES</a>) we got the rather crude red boxes for various metrics on the diagnostics page. The two that stood out were high Garbage Collection and disk swaps. The main thing causing this was that we were using OpenJDK instead of the Oracle JVM. If you are using OpenJDK, change it now! The swappiness setting was less impactful but resolved some of the issues caused by the frequent writing to disk.</p>

<p>Now we increased scale well, until we moved our bottleneck from our Elastic Search cluster to our API boxes.</p>

<h2>And some things are limits of the technology</h2>

<p>Now the API boxes were the problem we realised that basically serialisation and deserialisation is the bottleneck. The number of boxes can be scaled out (more servers) or serialisation removed. Also your programming language can be the limiting factor here. So we are now looking around at the best language as an option for speeding things up.</p>

<h2>So what now</h2>

<p>We have tweaked the ES set-up and scaled out our API servers and our benchmark improved (the amount of traffic can we serve). We have a roadmap for how to take more and more traffic but the response time is probably as fast as we can go if we keep the same methodology. As a result we are actually looking at using Elastic Search a lot less than we originally planned. We need to take serialisation out of the game where possible, using in-memory filtering seems a candidate again.</p>

<h2>That&#8217;s it for Elastic Search?</h2>

<p>Not at all, we love it. We are definitely still going to use for autocomplete, free-text search and also other indexing we want to do with future feature plans we have.</p>

<p>It was our fault we made some stupid errors with it, but our architecture and technology decisions just prevent us using it for our one, currently most important, use case, right now.</p>

<p>Also solving serialisation issues creatively might mean we can use ES again.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Get performance testing into your deployment pipeline, consider testing in production and expect the worst. The worst being that you might have got something stupid wrong and it is only exposed when you really don&#8217;t want it to be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I joined OpenTable I’ve been experimenting with performance monitoring, specifically on web services. One of the projects my team is responsible for is a REST API that provides UI elements for HTML5 applications, shaped as HTML snippets and static resources. Our consumers are websites deployed in multiple parts of the world, so our service needs to be fast and reliable.</p>

<h2>The why</h2>

<p>A couple of weeks after joining the company I decided, as part of my <a href="http://tech.toptable.co.uk/blog/2014/02/06/20-percent-time/">innovation time</a>, to rebuild the core of a .NET WebApi project in node.js in order to have a working prototype that could do exactly the same job as the original one, and could help me to observe how the two applications could react with similar volumes of traffic. After managing to make the two apis run on two clean VMs with the same configuration, I wrote a little node.js script to start performing some requests and test the response times. After seeing the results I thought that something was going wrong:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After trying to microbenchmark different layers of the software, I found the problem. On the .NET side I was reading a file synchronously, for every request; the file system’s library used with the node.js app, instead, was automatically caching the reads as default. After setting up a basic caching mechanism in the .NET app and running my script again the node.js API was only 1.4 times faster. After finding and solving that issue I thought how badly the application could have handled concurrency when deployed in production, even if it was heavily unit tested, the specs were well defined, and it was built using all the best techniques we all love.</p>

<p>As developers we rely on technologies that, with a minimum effort, can guarantee some pretty decent results in terms of performance. Modern web frameworks handle concurrency and thread management without requiring much plumbing code. Sophisticated and relatively cheap cloud services help us monitor our applications, providing dashboards, reports and alerting systems. Deploying on the cloud we can run our services and even auto-scale them depending on how much power we need. Even with these tools we must still own the responsibility of writing good quality code, testing it properly, and deploying as fast as possible in order to optimise the delivery process of our products.</p>

<p>But what about performance? I mean, what about the relationship between the code we write every day, and the way we impact overall performance? Are we sure that we are not deploying to production something that is degrading our services’ performance?</p>

<h2>The how</h2>

<p>Talking about the ‘why’ could be relatively easy, but the ‘how’ is a controversial topic. In my experience there are three important steps to any dish. First, we need the right tools to manipulate the ingredients. I tried many different tools but I couldn&#8217;t find a good fit for all my benchmarking requirements. It always makes sense to start with something to get you going but after a while it is important to find what’s the best for you, your team, and your project.</p>

<p>Then, you start cooking: personally, the number of things I’ve learned by just starting to benchmark some services is incredible. Nevertheless, as with every time we talk about metrics, it is key to know what is important about the data we are analysing, recognise the false positives/negatives and be aware of vanity metrics that could emphasize something irrelevant, or, more importantly, hide something significant.</p>

<p>The last step is simple: react and persist. If you discover something relevant, you can do something to improve the quality of your software.  With the right tools you can write some benchmark tests to target different layers of your software and execute them each and every time you contribute to that repository.  Doing this helps you keep your system performance under control which is really valuable.</p>

<h2>The how, for me</h2>

<p>When I found that little bug in the application (and it wasn’t actually a bug in the way we usually define them, as it wasn’t breaking any test or any software’s feature), I decided to spend some time to make my benchmark script better, in order to support different HTTP verbs, HTTPS, and a few things I needed to test all the routes of the API in a easy way. The goal was to wrap my little script as a <a href="http://www.gruntjs.com">grunt.js</a> module, (we use Teamcity as a CI platform and we already use grunt to run various tasks during our release process). I wanted to run this benchmarks externally to avoid interfering with the performance of the application, and to have a configuration-based simple-to-use tool.</p>

<p>So after some refactoring I started working on <a href="https://github.com/matteofigus/api-benchmark">api-benchmark</a> and its grunt wrapper <a href="https://github.com/matteofigus/grunt-api-benchmark">grunt-api-benchmark</a>, in order to make performance testing part of our continuous delivery process. A couple of days later my team was using it to run benchmark tests on our pre-prod environments against our APIs, running some hundreds of requests on each route every time we made a single commit to Github. What I managed to do was to break the build if response times were not good enough (stopping the production deployment), and producing a tiny report with some graphs, in order to have something useful to observe and eventually collect. Now, a couple of months later, a lot of functionality has been added and other teams are using it with success.</p>

<p>In case of RESTful services, it is possible to make series of requests to test response times, find peaks and classify errors; it is possible to perform concurrent calls to see how many parallel requests your service can handle (when deployed in single boxes, or when load balanced and globalised); and every time grunt runs everything is saved and plotted to readable and shareable graphs, so the knowledge can be shared between people that belong to different backgrounds.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/api_benchmark.png"></p>

<p>A lot of other features are still under development, including support for SOAP services and historical analysis (compare results from previous benchmarks and create historical graphs to represent the evolution of your software).</p>

<h2>How it works &amp; how to use it</h2>

<p>The way it works is simple. A configuration file contains the list of all the routes of the API. For each route it is possible to set different parameters such as headers, methods, expected status code, and expected response times. Other options that can be set such as the minimum number of samples, the maximum time for collecting the results, the number of concurrent requests, etc. It should be something like:</p>

<p>Then it is possible to include the script in a project that is written in any language and runs on any platform. The only requirement is to <a href="http://www.nodejs.org">install node.js</a> on that machine. If the project doesn’t have a package.json file in the root of your project, it’s as easy as doing:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>npm init
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once this is complete, include and install grunt-api-benchmark as a dependency (if you are not on Windows, you may want to sudo it depending on how you’ve installed node.js):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The last thing to do is to create a task inside your Gruntfile.js. Create one if you already don’t have one, and then add the ‘api_benchmark’ task in order to have something like this:</p>

<h2>Let’s benchmark - some lessons learned</h2>

<p>I think this is the most important part of the whole process, however I don’t think there are any general rules that are applicable for every context. I believe that after testing and stressing your system you will find out what matters to you and to your business. Nevertheless, I want to share some of the lessons I’ve learned.</p>

<p>First, set-up everything correctly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Benchmarks need to run always on the same machine, same agent, and same configuration to be reliable and comparable.</li>
<li>The network should be tested to be sure there aren’t any particular limits that would affect the benchmarks. It should be tested each time before running any benchmarks and could include things like bandwidth, host name correctness, and OS limitations.</li>
<li>Don’t run the tests from the same machine that hosts the application. Run it from the outside, and if you deploy in different regions, keep that in mind when you look at the results.</li>
</ul>


<p>When you benchmark, remember that stress and performance are two different things.</p>

<ul>
<li>You should test both to learn about performance but also your limits, in order to have an idea on how to scale your application or how to fix it when necessary.</li>
<li>10 seconds is not enough. 1 minute is nice, 5 is better.</li>
<li>One route is not enough. Testing all the routes allow us to see the difference between different response lengths.</li>
<li>Sometimes your application needs a warm-up, especially if you test it after a deployment. Set up a script to do that or set a proper time-out to be sure you are retrieving some valuable numbers back.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t benchmark the live production environment. Your results are affected by too many variables. If possible, set-up a staging environment with exactly the same configuration to run benchmarks.</li>
</ul>


<p>If necessary, adapt your API to be more testable through some very basic design patterns.</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance could depend on synchronous calls to third-party APIs or databases. Ideally routes should have an optional parameter to mock external dependencies so we should test that as well.</li>
<li>Ensure that changes to data or the operating environment are not persisted after the benchmarks complete. This is important to ensure no side effects on subsequent runs and will allow you to  benchmark production boxes if needed (after the deployment and obviously before directing any traffic to them).</li>
</ul>


<p>Last but not least, let’s analyse the data</p>

<ul>
<li>Averages are not enough, peaks are important, investigate them.</li>
<li>When something unexpected happens, try to reproduce it in order to fix it.</li>
<li>If wildly different numbers come up every time you run the tests, your API is depending on too many unpredictable events. Try to fix it. Try to run benchmarks locally and microbenchmark your software until you find the element that is causing the unpredictability. Then, fix it or find a way to mock it if you have no other option.</li>
<li>Numbers should be readable and shareable by everyone. Find a tool that dashboards your results and easily allow you to share that data.</li>
</ul>


<h2>‘benchmarking’ != ‘monitoring’;</h2>

<p>Benchmarking doesn’t equal and doesn’t replace monitoring. Once you start having an extensive knowledge about your system’s performance, you can find useful and easy to establish correlations between your benchmarks and your monitoring metrics. Depending on the scale of your system, it could be something very important.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I believe that taking care of performance is our responsibility, as developers. We can and should do more, and I hope this subject will gain more interest. In the meanwhile, if <a href="https://github.com/matteofigus/api-benchmark">api-benchmark</a> sounds interesting for you and you are interested in trying it or contributing (it is totally open-source), don’t hesitate to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/matteofigus">get in touch with me</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Popular topic at conferences</h2>

<p>A lot of us were lucky enough to attend NDC London this year, we even sponsored one of the food stalls. I often see one or more real themes coming from talks at conferences. At NDC London I saw three talks around scaling Agile. Indeed Dan North&#8217;s (<a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod">@tastapod</a>) talk was called exactly that. It is a topic OpenTable is trying to make happen. We are about 100 engineers on three continents which is a lot of teams working together.</p>

<p>I truly believe that the only way to make an individual team successful in an Agile environment is to have ownership of an area, a system or similar. That enables fast feedback, quick decision making and also a sense of pride and responsibility for what people are working on.</p>

<p>However, when you have a big project, you can&#8217;t give it to just one team. You need many teams working together. You can split it up and get teams to work on the parts of the project affecting the code they own. This will though mean certain parts of the project go faster than others, and if teams are autonomous, who is really responsible for bringing all those pieces together? Also, imagine you are the project owner and need to have a rough handle on when things can actually be delivered, who is going to give you that? None of the individual teams know, everyone is Agile and cool and so everyone hates estimates.</p>

<p>The point made by three speakers at NDC London, <a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod">Dan North</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble">Jez Humble</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gojkoadzic">Gojko Adzic</a> came down to the need for the coordination piece across the teams. One thing Dan North (more or less) said is <em>&#8220;if your team is really fast and all the others are slow, the project is slow and your team haven&#8217;t achieved their goal&#8221;</em>. That was not the exact words he used but the sentiment came across.</p>

<p>Indeed we have some big projects at OpenTable and as we have properly embraced Agile in many ways, we still had some pain points in this exact area. We were getting to the same conclusions but since these talks we have had some more solid programme management and in the third cross-team meeting as a result, things starting taking shape. It really is an important piece of the jigsaw.</p>

<p>I would also recommend a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILP1pJAuT9c&amp;list=PLBMFXMTB7U74NdDghygvBaDcp67owVUUF&amp;feature=c4-overview-vl">DevDay talk</a> from Dariusz Dziuk on this and how Spotify make things scale. Slightly different content but a similar theme.</p>

<time datetime="2014-02-10T13:46:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 10<span>th</span>, 2014</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In years gone by, we were a traditional IT company. We had teams of developers and operations. They rarely mixed. Around nine months ago we started to really try and get these teams working together. We introduced a configuration management tool, <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet">Puppet</a>, into our ecosystem.</p>

<p>Configuration management is one of the steps of continuous delivery that developers often forget. They feel that systems are magically created for them to deploy their application to. I used to believe this. When I was focused on developing software, I never gave any thought as to the work our operations team had to do to keep the train on the track. So give some respect to your operations teams! We created a repository and started to experiment by configuring some of our applications using Puppet.</p>

<p>This was a major step for both sets of teams. The developers started being in charge of the configuration of their application. This meant that their application would guarantee to be configured the same in our CI environment as it was in production. We, as developers, would be more confident of our applications working as expected.</p>

<p>To contribute to the project, as an engineer, you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>fork the project</li>
<li>make the changes you require</li>
<li>test the changes in a Vagrant environment (already created with a Windows and Linux system)</li>
<li>send a PR (pull request)</li>
</ul>


<p>We have just merged our #847 pull request. The stats of the repository look as follows:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/puppet-adoption.png"></p>

<p>Our puppet repository has had contributions from over 40% of our engineering / operations teams. We use Puppet to manage our application servers, DHCP servers, provisioning systems and even our MS Sql Server continuous integration infrastructure. The adoption has been fantastic. We started by running our internal QA infrastructure and then scaled it out to our production infrastructure. We now manage 548 nodes (a combination of internal and production) via Puppet.</p>

<p>Using a project called <a href="www.fullybaked.co.uk/articles/getting-gource-running-on-osx">Gource</a>, one of our engineering leads, <a href="http://twitter.com/ryantomlinson">Ryan Tomlinson</a>, created a video of the repository vizualization. It&#8217;s just over two minutes long and shows the activity the repository has taken.</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/86201508 "></iframe></div>


<p>Each branch in the tree relates to a directory inside our repository. Green zaps are additions, orange are updates and red deletions. The important thing to take from the video is the evolution of the repository, the amount of changes and the number of people pushing those changes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very happy with our configuration management adoption. We are by no means at a point where everyone does it, but we are working towards that. I would like our contributors to rise to over 75% of our engineering / operations team by the end of 2014. Let&#8217;s see how that goes&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We allow all our UK based developers to have some time to explore new technologies, try out prototypes and clean-up things that escape the day-to-day process. Two days out of ten, seems a lot doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<h2>How we started</h2>

<p>We started doing our 20% time when we had two week sprints with a release each sprint. We actually had three days of testing, small bug fixing and signing things off. We didn&#8217;t like starting our new stories for the next sprint as our QAs got behind and never really caught up. We decided to use this time more for clean-up but also for prototyping or trying something out. We had read of other companies doing something similar so were excited to give it a go.</p>

<p>One of the first times we did this we actually decided we wanted to automate all the testing of one of our systems, so that our QAs weren&#8217;t bogged down for those three days. In our first 20% time, we got most of the team on board as it was painful watching, let alone doing manual testing and we wanted faster feedback on our changes.</p>

<p>We got a lot of the system in a state we could test it. We basically wrote a lot of a page object model and a few features to talk to it. The next 20% time it needed cleaning up, the next we had a lot under test. With a bit of work the three day test cycle was down to about one day. This would never have happened if we were trying in normal sprint time. Major win number one and something no business owner had had to wrestle against other priorities.</p>

<p>After this instance we have had numerous similar examples, albeit on a smaller scale, where each team has been able to try things out, with no consequence in the event of failure, and achieved great prototypes. Much of our new architecture has been tested out in these sessions, new technologies, new approaches, can people work together?</p>

<h2>Failures, not so bad after all</h2>

<p>Of course, we have had many failures, but maybe even that helps, we won&#8217;t waste our proper sprint time. Some people ask me about rules when I talk about this. I think the key for me is that the engineers are truly given freedom to explore. If on the face of things something they are doing is completely away from what you are doing then it might seem a bit strange.</p>

<p>But what if they are looking to try something new and would have left your company to do so? What if they think it might be a solution but don&#8217;t know how to say? What if they can use it in nine months on an urgent project? All these things can and have happened.</p>

<h2>Fear, as always, is detrimental</h2>

<p>Another rule, <em>no fear</em>,  applies in many situations of course. But unlike hackathons where you feel the need to present at the end, presenting should be through excitement of the creator, not demand of the manager.</p>

<h2>Better team as a result</h2>

<p>I have seen our whole UK engineering group get a lot stronger through our use of 20% time. We have also been more attractive in interviews and gets very positive responses when discussing our job openings; so many developers just want an opportunity to learn and apply new skills and will leave a job to do so.</p>

<p>I personally now have a child, attempting to try new skills and experiment at home is proving harder and harder. This 20% time becomes more important &ndash; as a team we are trying to really get to grips with the latest trends in the development community. I just don&#8217;t have anywhere near as much time in the evenings now, it is a way to stop a divide coming between your team, the ones with spare time and the ones without.</p>

<p>I recommend giving it some serious thought for your organisation.</p>
