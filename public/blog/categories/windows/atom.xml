    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/04/04/testing-puppet-with-beaker/">part one</a> we discussed our first steps into the world of acceptance testing our Puppet manifests.
By using Beaker we able to test managing local users on our Linux boxes. This was a positive experience for us. It allowed us to get to grips with the basics of configuring
Beaker to run tests and configuring our node sets to run those tests against. In this post, we will be discussing how we went about getting Beaker working with Windows.</p>

<p>As many of your reading this will be aware, OpenTable currently has quite a large Windows infrastructure and we are using Puppet extensively to maintain that environment.
We are also moving forward with releasing as many of our modules open source onto the <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable">Puppet Forge</a> as possible (11 out of 18 of which are Windows
exclusive). What this means is that there was no way that we could ignore trying to use Beaker to test our manifests against Windows. We knew that we would have to support
many different versions and editions of Windows out there in the community as well that the ones we have to support internally.</p>

<p>This was going to be a challenge (configuration management with Windows usually is) but we were up for it.</p>

<h2>The Preliminaries</h2>

<h3>Serverspec</h3>

<p>The first step was looking at Serverspec. Serverspec is a Ruby gem that provides extensions to RSpec that allow you to test the actual state of your servers, either locally
or from the outside in via SSH. What we needed to know was did it support Windows? The answer was thankfully a resounding &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;. All the <a href="http://serverspec.org/resource_types.html">resource types</a> that you might want to test including file, service and user are available and supported on Windows. There are also a couple of Windows specific ones such as iis_website, Windows_feature and Windows_registry_key. We even added our own to support <a href="https://github.com/serverspec/serverspec/pull/403/files">Windows_scheduled_task</a>. Interestingly Serverspec also supports WinRM as an alternative to SSH when you are testing from the outside-in but we will go back into that later. As long as your using Serverspec > 1.6 you will have all the Windows support you might need.</p>

<h3>Packer</h3>

<p>Step two was to build some Windows Vagrant boxes to test against. The documentation on the <a href="http://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/wiki">wiki</a> was (at the time) a bit slim when it came
to building test boxes but we knew we needed Cygwin so we went ahead and created the boxes that we needed. All our boxes are created with Packer <a href="http://github.com/opentable/packer-images">and are open sourced on GitHub</a>. They have also been <a href="http://vagrantcloud.com/opentable">published to Vagrant Cloud</a>
so you can download pre-built images and get up and running quickly (version 1.x images contain the Cygwin installation).</p>

<h3>Beaker</h3>

<p>So far, so good. We hit a couple of issues in our initial test runs with Beaker: missing module_path, installation using the msi and 32-bit Windows support &ndash; but these were very
small issues and we were happy to be able to contribute back some changes (<a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/234">234</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/235">235</a>, <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/236">236</a>). We were very happy and managed to get out first module tested,
the <a href="http://github.com/opentable/puppet-puppetversion/">cross-platform module puppet-puppetversion</a> for doing Puppet upgrades.</p>

<h2>The First Example</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a more detailed look at those puppetversion tests, how we configured Beaker to run and how it changed for the Windows support. I am going to assume at this point that
you already have some familiarity with Beaker; if not and this is your first steps into the testing tool then I would suggest going back and read <a href="http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/04/04/testing-puppet-with-beaker/">part one</a> of this series which contains a little bit of background to this and some useful resources for getting started.</p>

<p>The first thing that we needed to change for Windows was our <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opentable/puppet-puppetversion/master/spec/spec_helper_acceptance.rb">spec_accepentance.rb file</a>.</p>

<p>Step one was to include the appropriate Serverspec helpers. What this does is let Serverspec know that we are executing on Windows so that underlying resources work correctly. We are also telling
server spec here to communicate using WinRM.</p>

<pre><code>require 'beaker-rspec/spec_helper'
require 'beaker-rspec/helpers/serverspec'
require 'winrm'

hosts.each do |host|
  case host['platform']
    when /windows/
      include Serverspec::Helper::Windows
      include Serverspec::Helper::WinRM

      version = ENV['PUPPET_VERSION'] || '3.4.3'

      install_puppet(:version =&gt; version)

  else
    install_puppet
  end
end

...
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is to configure WinRM so that it can connect properly. In our case this meant connecting to Vagrant boxes.</p>

<pre><code>...

RSpec.configure do |c|
  ...
  hosts.each do |host|
    c.host = host

    if host['platform'] =~ /windows/
      endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:5985/wsman"
      c.winrm = ::WinRM::WinRMWebService.new(endpoint, :ssl, :user =&gt; 'vagrant', :pass =&gt; 'vagrant', :basic_auth_only =&gt; true)
      c.winrm.set_timeout 300
    end

    ...
  end
end

...
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at one of the tests themselves.</p>

<p>The first part should look pretty familiar. We use the face(&lsquo;osfamily&rsquo;) helper in Beaker to make sure that the test itself is only ever executed for our Windows hosts. We are then running an apply_manifest two times in order to validate that the manifest is idempotent. The only different here is that we are specifying a custom Windows-specific module_path.</p>

<pre><code>...
require 'spec_helper_acceptance'

describe 'puppetversion', :unless =&gt; UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORMS.include?(fact('osfamily')) do
  ...

  context 'upgrade on windows', :if =&gt; fact('osfamily').eql?('windows') do

  it 'should install the new version' do
    pp = &lt;&lt;-PP
      class { 'puppetversion':
        version =&gt; '3.5.1',
        time_delay =&gt; 1
      }
    PP

    apply_manifest(pp, :modulepath =&gt; 'C:/ProgramData/PuppetLabs/puppet/etc/modules', :catch_failures =&gt; true)
    expect(apply_manifest(pp, :modulepath =&gt; 'C:/ProgramData/PuppetLabs/puppet/etc/modules', :catch_failures =&gt; true).exit_code).to be_zero
  end
</code></pre>

<p>The next part is where we actually perform the bulk of the tests. In the case of this module, we are testing
that the scheduled task has run and that Puppet has been upgraded to the appropriate version. We are making use
of the Windows_scheduled_task resource that we created earlier:</p>

<pre><code>  describe Windows_scheduled_task('puppet upgrade task') do
    it { should exist }
  end

  #This will fail if your laptop (and therefor the Vagrant vm) is not running on AC power
  describe package('puppet') do
    it {
      sleep(240) #Wait for the task to execute
      should be_installed.with_version('3.5.1')
    }
  end

  describe Windows_scheduled_task('puppet upgrade task') do
    it {
      pp = &lt;&lt;-PP
        class { 'puppetversion':
          version =&gt; '3.5.1'
        }
      PP

      apply_manifest(pp, :modulepath =&gt; 'C:/ProgramData/PuppetLabs/puppet/etc/modules', :catch_failures =&gt; true)

      should_not exist
    }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The final part was to configure the nodeset file for the Windows box that we wanted to run our test against:</p>

<pre><code>HOSTS:
  windows-2008R2-serverstandard-x64:
  roles:
    - agent
  platform: windows-server-amd64
  box : opentable/win-2008r2-standard-amd64-nocm
  box_url : opentable/win-2008r2-standard-amd64-nocm
  hypervisor : vagrant
  user: vagrant
CONFIG:
  log_level: verbose
  type: git
</code></pre>

<p>This was working well for us so we continued on to our next module.</p>

<p>The next module we chose to look at was <a href="http://github.com/opentable/puppet-Windowsfeature">puppet-Windowsfeature</a>.</p>

<p>The test we have implemented in this moudle looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>require 'spec_helper_acceptance'

describe 'Windowsfeature' do
  context 'windows feature should be installed' do
    it 'should install .net 3.5 feature' do

      pp = &lt;&lt;-PP
        Windowsfeature { 'as-net-framework': }
      PP

      apply_manifest(pp, :catch_failures =&gt; true)
      expect(apply_manifest(pp, :catch_failures =&gt; true).exit_code).to be_zero
    end

    describe Windows_feature('as-net-framework') do
      it { should be_installed.by('powershell') }
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This module was a little more tricky. Why? Installing Windows features requires elevated permissions. What this meant is that when Beaker attempted to SSH into our Windows box and our Puppet module ran its underlying PowerShell we were faced with a harsh and non-descriptive <strong>&ldquo;Access is denied error&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<h2>SSH</h2>

<p>Not all SSH daemons are created equal. To understand the &ldquo;Access is denied error&rdquo; we were seeing and why it happens you need to understand a little bit about how sshd on Cygwin works. You can read all about the details from the Cygwin forum archives (<a href="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-09/msg00087.html">[1]</a>, <a href="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2006-06/msg00862.html">[2]</a>, <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.os.cygwin/128472">[3]</a>, <a href="https://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/ntsec.html#ntsec-nopasswd1">[4]</a>) but TLDR; is that you need to use a username and password rather than private key authentication in order to get reasonable admin permissions. Having said all that, and having read all the documentation about the issue above we were still facing the same problem so we had to look at alternative options.</p>

<p>There are several paths you can go down and I want to tell you about them here to save you a similar yak shave:</p>

<h3>OpenSSH for Windows</h3>

<p>A thinner alternative than having to install the full Cygwin stack using OpenSSH for Windows is the same OpenSSH implementation. The issue here however is that it doesn’t contain some of the Unix binaries required for Beaker to function. You can work around this if you have Git for Windows installed on your machine by putting its bin directory on your path but overall this doesn’t really solve any of the issues we were facing. We get a lighter footprint on the machine but still the same error as before</p>

<h3>Bitvise SSH Server</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.bitvise.com/ssh-server-download">Bitvise SSH Server</a> is an alternative SSH implementation (of which there are many more listed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_servers">Wikipedia</a>). It resolves the permissions issue (it deals with the elevation internally) and has the benefit that it provides a proper command shell rather than a emulated bash shell. It also means we don’t have to have any binaries on there that we don’t need &ndash; a big plus. It would mean that we needed to make a few small changes to Beaker in order to replace some of the internal bash command with Windows alternatives but this was not a big task to do and is something we could contribute back.</p>

<h3>WinRM</h3>

<p>Could we do away with SSH altogether? It eliminates the problem we were facing and also means we don’t have to install anything on our Windows boxes &ndash; it’s all built in already. This would be an ideal solution but does all our tooling support it? I’ll discuss this in a little bit more detail later.</p>

<h3>Not use Beaker at all</h3>

<p>The nuclear option. If we couldn’t get anything to work we could not use Beaker at all, we could try and use Test Kitchen (with <a href="https://github.com/neillturner/kitchen-puppet">test-kitchen-puppet</a>) or some hand-rolled solution. Not the best idea, for us or the community but we though we might have to go down this path at one point. We even added <a href="https://github.com/liamjbennett/kitchen-puppet/tree/Windows_support">Windows support to test-kitchen-puppet</a> as part our diversion in this direction.</p>

<h2>What worked in the end:</h2>

<p>So we went down all these avenues and decided that the best option for us was to use Bitvise. It fixed the problem we were facing but it meant that we had some work ahead of us:
1. We had to rebuild all our Windows images with Bitvise rather than Cygwin (<a href="https://vagrantcloud.com/opentable">vagrantcloud.com/opentable</a> &ndash; version 2.x images now have this)
2. We had to make some changes to Beaker to support using a standard Windows command shell rather than a Unix shell:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/419">https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/419</a> – configure_puppet method</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/420">https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/419</a> – host_entry method</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/418">https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/419</a> – Vagrant box_version</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/424">https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/419</a> – Bitvise SSH</li>
</ul>


<p>With it finally working we had something that looked like this:</p>

<h2>Second Example</h2>

<p>Well with all the changes we implemented there were actually very few changes that we needed to make to our actual tests code.</p>

<p>No adjustments are needed for our spec_acceptance.rb file.</p>

<p>No adjustments are required for our spec file (show above).</p>

<p>The main change we made was in the nodeset file:</p>

<pre><code>HOSTS:
  win-2008R2-std:
  roles:
    - default
    - agent
  platform: Windows-server-amd64
  box: opentable/win-2008r2-standard-amd64-nocm
  hypervisor: vagrant
  user: vagrant
  ip: '10.255.33.129'
  communicator: bitvise
CONFIG:
  log_level: verbose
  type: git
</code></pre>

<p>The biggest change you will see here is the addition of the &lsquo;communicator&rsquo; option. What this does is to allows us to actively select to use either Cygwin or Bitvise. This means that in our case we want to use Bitvise SSH as this fixes the error we were seeing and it&rsquo;s the version of SSH now installed on your newer Vagrant boxes. Bitvise is the only supported option at the moment (in our Beaker fork) but it is likely that this will soon support WinRM as well.</p>

<p>Things to note here:
* The name of the Windows host defined in the node set must be the same as the name of the Windows hostname &ndash; if it is not then when Vagrant boots up it will change the hostname
which will put Windows into a &ldquo;restart pending&rdquo; state.</p>

<h2>The Future and WinRM</h2>

<p>Most modern versions of Windows server have WinRM enabled by default but if you are using an older version or you are attempting to test a client then you will need to make sure
that this is enabled on your boxes. This is still the direction that we would like to go long-term as it is the most Windows-friendly approach but there are few road blocks in
the way of doing so right now:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Packer doesn’t set support WinRM as a communication method. This is being actively worked on and you can follow the work here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/packer/issues/451">https://github.com/mitchellh/packer/issues/451</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dylanmei/packer-communicator-winrm">https://github.com/dylanmei/packer-communicator-winrm</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Beaker doesn’t yet support WinRM as a communication protocol. This is currently being discussed internally after we raised the idea. The work that we have completed for
Bitvise support will go some way it allowing other providers, such as wirm going forward and therefore WinRM support should be coming in the near future.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Using Beaker to test modules for Windows has been a long and complicated journey. I have attempted to cover here all the problems that you might run into when trying to do this for yourselves and provide some good examples to get you going. You will soon see this being rolled out to all of the OpenTable open source modules shortly so you will have some complete working examples to reference. We will continue to work with PuppetLabs in improving Beaker (and its Windows support) in order to make this a easy process for everyone.</p>

    <link href="http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/05/15/managing-windows-features-with-puppet/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-15T16:12:38+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/05/15/managing-windows-features-with-puppet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in June 2013, I wrote about <a href="http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2013/06/14/windows-feature-management-with-powershell/">Windows Feature Management with PowerShell</a>. We have since released a Puppet module that will do this for us. We originally wrote PowerShell:</p>

<pre><code>Import-Module ServerManager
Add-WindowsFeature Web-Asp-Net
</code></pre>

<p>The Puppet module now wraps this code as follows:</p>

<pre><code>windowsfeature { 'Web-Asp-Net': }
</code></pre>

<p>The declaration windowsfeature is a specific Puppet type called a <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/definedtypes.html">define</a>. In developer terms, this is the equivalent of a helper method that can be reused. We can also make sure that Windows Features are <em>not</em> installed on the server as follows:</p>

<pre><code>windowsfeature { 'Telnet-Server': 
  ensure =&gt; absent 
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the backing code for the module, we do a check before we install / uninstall any windows features. This means that we will only make the changes we really need to. This ensures idempotency of the script. By using this class, we can build up a list of what features a server should have enabled / installed on it. As example manifest would look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>class my_windows_features {
  windowsfeature { 'Web-Asp-Net': }
  windowsfeature { 'Web-Net-Ext': }
  windowsfeature { 'Web-ISAPI-Ext': }
  windowsfeature { 'Web-ISAPI-Filter': }
  windowsfeature { 'Web-Mgmt-Tools': }
  windowsfeature { 'Web-Mgmt-Console': }
  windowsfeature { 'Telnet-Server': ensure =&gt; absent }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The server will have it&rsquo;s shipping list of Windows Features checked every 30 minutes by Puppet. We are sure that any changes encountered during that time will be applied as expected.  You can find more about our WindowsFeature module on the <a href="http://github.com/opentable/puppet-windowsfeature">github repo</a>. If you want to use the module, then you can install it using the Puppet Module tool via the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/windowsfeature">Puppet Forge</a></p>

    <updated>2014-05-13T15:25:16+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/05/13/managing-windows-web-applications-with-puppet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of our move towards a configuration management tool, we really wanted to start automating as much of our infrastructure as possible. This included our application configuration stack. IIS management is pretty easy with PowerShell. It would look something like this</p>

<pre><code>Import-Module WebAdministration
New-WebSite -Name "DemoSite" -Port 80 -IP * -PhysicalPath "c:\inetpub\wwwroot" -ApplicationPool "MyAppPool"
</code></pre>

<p>This would of course set up a website called &lsquo;DemoSite&rsquo; running on port 80 on the local machine. The cmdlets that come with PowerShell make this pretty easy. This is great if it is a one-off job to set up a site. We run our websites from a number of webservers, therefore, it would be silly to have to RDP into each webserver and run a script on it. This is why tools like Puppet, Chef, Ansible etc. exist. We needed a configuration management tool to do this work for us. It has a number of benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Orchestration</li>
<li>Idempotency</li>
<li>Makes sure that each server is configured in &lsquo;exactly&rsquo; the same way as no human intervention is needed</li>
<li>Developers can help the operations team by creating the scripts needed. This is great for collaboration between teams</li>
</ul>


<p>On investigating how we would do this with Puppet, we noticed that there were not many other people managing their site in this way. Therefore, we would have to turn our PowerShell scripts into Puppet modules to manage our system.</p>

<p>We have since created a Puppet module to manage IIS. To manage IIS with Puppet, we can now write the following code:</p>

<pre><code>iis::manage_site { 'DemoSite:
   site_path     =&gt; 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot',
   port          =&gt; '80',
   ip_address    =&gt; '*',
   app_pool      =&gt; 'MyAppPool'
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would produce <strong>exactly</strong> the same results as the code from above. But it has 1 difference. There are checks in the code behind this module that will mean the code will only execute when it is needed, i.e. when the site_path isn&rsquo;t correct or the app_pool isn&rsquo;t correct. This is idempotency. The script can be run again and again and again&hellip;.</p>

<p>To create an application binding, we used to do this in PowerShell:</p>

<pre><code>Import-Module WebAdministration
New-WebBinding -Name 'DemoSite' -Port '8080' -IPAddress '*'
</code></pre>

<p>This would set up an extra binding on port 8080 for the site, DemoSite. We replaced this code with our puppet equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>iis::manage_binding { 'DemoSite-8080':
  site_name   =&gt; 'DemoSite',
  protocol    =&gt; 'http',
  port        =&gt; '8080',
  ip_address  =&gt; '*',
}
</code></pre>

<p>To create a virtual application, we would write the PowerShell:</p>

<pre><code>Import-Module WebAdministration
New-WebApplication -Name 'VirtualApp' -Site 'DemoSite' -PhysicalPath 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\MyVirtualApp' -ApplicationPool 'MyAppPool'
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a VirtualApp folder on the DemoSite, use the same application pool and then set the path of the folder. I can do the same thing in Puppet as follows:</p>

<pre><code>iis::manage_virtual_application {'VirtualApp':
  site_name   =&gt; 'DemoSite',
  site_path   =&gt; 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot\MyVirtualApplication',
  app_pool    =&gt; 'MyAppPool'
 }  
</code></pre>

<p>We can therefore, chain a manifest together that does all this for us in 1 go. It would look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>class mywebsite {
  iis::manage_app_pool {'MyAppPool':
    enable_32_bit           =&gt; true,
    managed_runtime_version =&gt; 'v4.0',
  } -&gt;

  iis::manage_site {'DemoSite':
    site_path   =&gt; 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot',
    port        =&gt; '80',
    ip_address  =&gt; '*',
    app_pool    =&gt; 'MyAppPool'
  } -&gt;

  iis::manage_virtual_application {'VirtualApp':
    site_name  =&gt; 'DemoSite',
    site_path  =&gt; 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot\MyVirtualApp',
    app_pool   =&gt; 'MyAppPool'
  } -&gt; 

  iis::manage_binding {'DemoSite-8080':
    site_name  =&gt; 'DemoSite',
    protocol   =&gt; 'http',
    port       =&gt; '8080',
    ip_address =&gt; '*'
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The module does more than just these tasks and I could give more and more examples of what we wrote, but you can find more about our IIS module on the <a href="http://github.com/opentable/puppet-iis">github repo</a>. If you want to use the module, then you can install it using the Puppet Module tool via the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/iis">Puppet forge</a>.</p>

<p>We love to hear feedback on things that the module should support. We like Pull Requests even more :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of one of our recent <a href="http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/04/04/forgefriday-our-commitment-to-the-puppet-forge/">ForgeFriday</a> efforts we released a new module puppetversion with the purpose of managing the installation and upgrade of Puppet in a platform agnostic way.</p>

<p>This should be a very straightforward task to complete because this is one of the core resources that Puppet manages &ndash; the upgrading of packages. With that in mind, putting <code>package { ‘puppet’: ensure =&gt; $version }</code> in one of our base profiles would be all that was needed but alas it was not. In this blog I want to take you through the history, the bugs, the platforms and the edge-cases that make performing an in-place upgrade of Puppet a more complex task that it ought to be.</p>

<h2>Debian</h2>

<p>Like many, Ubuntu is our Debian derivative of choice for much of our newer production infrastructure. Debian, has the apt package management system and PuppetLabs provide the required deb packages as well as hosting their own apt repository to point our systems to. The main point of package management systems is that they take care of the dependency hell and the awkward upgrade paths all from within the confines of the package itself, and that is what happens with the PuppetLabs packages &ndash; great.</p>

<p>The problem that we had in some of our systems was that they had been built without the PuppetLabs apt repository. This means that they picked up a slightly older version of the Puppet packages from the main Ubuntu distribution repositories and didn’t have access to the newer versions of the Puppet packages. Ok, so we solved that with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>  exec { 'rm_duplicate_puppet_source':
    path    =&gt; '/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin',
    command =&gt; 'sed -i \'s:deb\ http\:\/\/apt.puppetlabs.com\/ precise main::\' /etc/apt/sources.list',
    onlyif  =&gt; 'grep \'deb http://apt.puppetlabs.com/ precise main\' /etc/apt/sources.list',
  }

  apt::source { 'puppetlabs':
    location    =&gt; 'http://apt.puppetlabs.com',
    repos       =&gt; 'main dependencies',
    key         =&gt; '4BD6EC30',
    key_content =&gt; template('puppetversion/puppetlabs.gpg'),
    require     =&gt; Exec['rm_duplicate_puppet_source']
  }
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;re making use of the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apt">puppetlabs/apt</a> module here. This removes the old reference and adding in the new apt source. Then we just add the package and ensure the version we’re upgrading. Perfect.</p>

<h2>RedHat</h2>

<p>Same problem different OS family &ndash; this time we had some older CentOS machines that needed fixing. Thankfully there is also a module <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/stahnma/puppetlabs_yum">stahnma/puppetlabs_yum</a> for the yum repositories. Add that in, add the package resource and start upgrading. Phew! This seems like it’s getting easier.</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>Many of you will be following the work of OpenTable closely because of our work with Puppet on Windows. We have a pretty large Windows infrastructure, with a wide range of client and server versions deployed ranging from 2012 R2 all the way back to the historic times of 2003. Windows also has its own package format, the msi, and PuppetLabs also provides all versions of Puppet packaged as msi files.</p>

<p>This is where it gets a little tricky. The big problem we had was that the Windows provider, prior to 3.4.0 was not versionable (<a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/21133">issues/21133</a>) that means that <code>package { ‘puppet’: ensure =&gt; installed }</code> would work but <code>package { ‘puppet’: ensure =&gt; $version }</code> would not &ndash; the exact thing we were trying to do! The only way to resolve that problem is to uninstall and reinstall the package with the correct version.</p>

<p>Now there are a lot of problems with the uninstall/reinstall approach. Firstly we had to script the process because Windows only allows one installer to run at any one time meaning that you had to wait for the uninstall to finish before that subsequent install takes place. Secondly we have to deal with Puppet runs and make sure that when the upgrade script runs that we wait for any active Puppet runs to complete before trying to uninstall Puppet. Next we have to trigger our script using a scheduled task.</p>

<p>Our experience with scheduled tasks has been painful. We attempted using the <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#scheduledtask">scheduled_task</a> resource type but soon realised that this wasn’t going to work for us. The resource type is good if you want to create a task to run at a fixed point in time but there is no way to provide a relative time e.g. “in five mins from now”. Also on occasion the task would not run or would silently fail &ndash; this was almost certainly due to another Puppet issue we discovered (<a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1368">PUP-1368</a>). Without being able to use the scheduled task resource we were again back in the land of Powershell using a script to create the scheduled task that would call our upgrade script.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re keeping up we now have something like this:</p>

<p>Puppet &ndash;> calls script to create scheduled task &ndash;> scheduled task calls upgrade script &ndash;> upgrade script upgrade Puppet and triggers next Puppet run &ndash;> Puppet</p>

<p>Nice little cycle there, but it works.</p>

<p>One final issue worth mentioning is that for Windows 2003 servers you’ll need to actually have Powershell installed. Luckily, we also have a module for that <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/dcharleston/powershell">dcharleston/powershell</a></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Well we’ve discussed some of the pain points, and we’ve discussed them in detail with PuppetLabs themselves. The advice here is to upgrade to Puppet 3.4.3 as soon as you can as many of these issues are resolved in that version. For those of you not on that version yet then we have you covered with our puppetversion module.</p>
