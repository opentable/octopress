    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Why this post?</h2>

<p>As a junior, I always find it easier to just sit and write code than actually stop to think about the theoretical basis that lie under the applications I work on. <strong>REST</strong>  is one of those terms I heard a lot about, so I decided to try to sum up what it means and how it affects the choices we make everyday as software engineers.</p>

<h2>Introduction to REST</h2>

<p>REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it can be defined as an architectural style used to build Web Services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable. A service that is designed by REST principles can be called a <strong>RESTful service</strong>.</p>

<p>It has been described first in 2000 by Roy Fielding, in a <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/webarch_icse2000.pdf">dissertation</a> called &ldquo;Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures&rdquo;. The basic idea was to describe the interactions between the components of a distributed system, putting constraints on them and emphasizing the importance of an uniform interface, that is abstracted from the single components.</p>

<p>REST is often applied to the design and development of web services, which is the scenario I&rsquo;ll try to address in this post.</p>

<p>The purpose of a web service can be summed up as follows: it exposes <strong>resources</strong> to a <strong>client</strong> so that it can have access to them (examples of typical resources include pictures, video files, web pages and business data).</p>

<p>Common features of a service that is built in a REST style are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Representations</li>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>URIs</li>
<li>Uniform Interface</li>
<li>Statelessness</li>
<li>Links between resources</li>
<li>Caching</li>
</ul>


<h2>Representations &ndash; what are they?</h2>

<p>REST style does not put a constraint into the way resources are represented, as long as their format is understandable by the client.</p>

<p>Good examples of data formats in which a resource could be returned from a service are <a href="http://www.json.org/"><strong>JSON</strong></a> (JavaScript Object Notation, which nowadays is the coolest one) and <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/"><strong>XML</strong></a> (Extensible Markup Language, used for more complex data structures). Say for instance a REST service has to expose the data related to a song, with its attributes. A way of doing it in JSON could be:</p>

<p>```json
{</p>

<pre><code>"ID": 1,
"title": "(You gotta) Fight for your right (To party)",
"artist": "Beastie Boys",
"album": "Licensed To Ill",
"year": 1986,
"genre": "Hip-Hop"
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Easy, huh?</p>

<p>Anyway, a service can represent a resource in a number of ways at the same time, leaving the client to choose which one is better suited for its needs. The important thing is that there is agreement on what format to send/expect.</p>

<p>The format that the client needs will be part of the <strong>request</strong> sent by the client.</p>

<p>The resource will be eventually sent by the service as part of what we call a <strong>response</strong>.</p>

<p>It has to be kept in mind that a resource should be completely described by the representation, since this is the only information the client will have. It has to be exaustive, but without exposing classified or useless information about the entity at the same time.</p>

<h2>Messages A.K.A. client and service chatting</h2>

<p>Q: So, how exactly do client and service exchange requests and responses?</p>

<p>A: They send messages.</p>

<p>In fact, to be more specific, the client will send an <strong>HTTP request</strong> to the service, specifying the following details:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>method</strong> that is called on the resource. It can correspond to a <em>GET</em>, a <em>POST</em>, a <em>PUT</em>, a <em>DELETE</em>, an <em>OPTIONS</em> or a <em>HEAD</em> operation.</li>
<li>The <strong>URI</strong> of the request. It identifies what is the resource on which the client wants to use the method. More on that later. For now let&rsquo;s say it is the only way the client knows how to call the needed resource.</li>
<li>The <strong>HTTP version</strong>, which is usually <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616"><em>HTTP/1.1</em></a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>request headers</strong>, which are the additional information passed, with the request, to the service. These fields are basically request modifiers, similar to the parameters sent to a programming language method, and they depend on the type of request sent. More on that later.</li>
<li>The <strong>request body</strong>: is the actual content of a message. In a RESTful service, it’s where the representation of resources sit. A body will not be present in a GET request, for instance, since it is a request to retrieve a resource rather than to create one, whereas a POST request will most likely have one.</li>
</ul>


<p>The request will then generate an <strong>HTTP response</strong> to the client, that will contain the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>HTTP version</strong>, same as above.</li>
<li>The <strong>response code</strong>: which is a three-digit status code sent back to the client. Can be of the <strong>1xx</strong> format (informational), <strong>2xx</strong> (success), <strong>3xx</strong> (redirect), <strong>4xx</strong> (client error), <strong>5xx</strong> (server error).</li>
<li>The <strong>response header</strong>, which contains metadata and settings related to the message.</li>
<li>The <strong>response body</strong>: contains the representation (if the request was successful).</li>
</ul>


<h2>URIs, home of the resources</h2>

<p>A requirement of REST is that each resource has to correspond to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier">URI</a> address, which unsurprisingly stands for Uniform Resource Identifier. Having URIs associated to resources is key, because they are the addresses on which the client is allowed to perform the operations on the resources. It is important to stress that according to REST an URI should describe a resource, but never the operation performed on it.</p>

<p>The addresses are usually constructed hierarchically, to allow readability. A typical resource URL could be written as: <code>http://serviceName/resourceName/resourceID</code></p>

<p>Basic guidelines to build well-structured URIs are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resources should be named with plural nouns, no verbs, using conventions throughout the whole service.</li>
<li>Query URIs <code>http://serviceName/resourceName?id=resourceID</code> should be used only when really necessary. They are not deprecated by REST style, but they are less readable than the normal URIs, and are ignored by search engines. On the upside, they allow the client to send parameters to the service, to refine the request for a specific subset of resources, or resources in a specific format.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Uniform interface, various operations</h2>

<p>Ok, so now that a client knows where a resource is reachable, how is it going to handle the resource? What are the operations that it can perform?</p>

<p>HTTP provides a set of methods that allow the client to perform standard operations on the service:</p>

<table style="margin-bottom:16px;">
    <tr>
        <th style="font-weight:bold;padding:5px 10px;border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;">Method</th>
        <th style="font-weight:bold;padding:5px 10px;border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;">Operation performed</th> 
        <th style="font-weight:bold;padding:5px 10px;border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;">Quality</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;font-weight:bold;">GET</td>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Read a resource</td> 
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Safe</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;font-weight:bold;">POST</td>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Insert a new resource, or update an existing one</td> 
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Not idempotent</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;font-weight:bold;">PUT</td>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Insert a new resource, or update an existing one</td> 
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Idempotent (see below)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;font-weight:bold;">DELETE</td>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Delete a resource</td> 
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Idempotent</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;font-weight:bold;">OPTIONS</td>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">List allowed operations on a resource</td> 
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Safe</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;font-weight:bold;">HEAD</td>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Return only the response header, no body</td> 
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Safe</td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p>The key difference between <em>POST</em> and <em>PUT</em> is that no matter how many times a <em>PUT</em> operation is performed, the result will be the same (this is what <em>idempotent</em> means), whereas with a <em>POST</em> operation a resource will be added or updated multiple times.</p>

<p>Another difference is that a client that sends a <em>PUT</em> request always need to know the exact URI to operate on, I.E. assigning a name or an ID to a resource. If the client is not able to do so, it has no choice but to use a POST request.</p>

<p>Finally, if the resource already exists, <em>POST</em> and <em>PUT</em> will update it in an identical fashion.</p>

<p>These operations, according to REST, should be available to the client as hyperlinks to the above described URIs, and that is how the client/service interface is constrained to be <em>uniform</em>.</p>

<h2>Statelessness of the client side</h2>

<p>A RESTful service does not maintain the application state client-side. This only allows the client to perform requests that are resource specific, and does not allow the client to perform operations that assume prior knowledge of past requests. The client only knows what to do based on the ability to read the hypertext it receives, knowing its media type.</p>

<p>This leads me to mention an important constraint of REST, that was also <a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">enforced by Fielding</a> after publishing his dissertation: hyperlinks within hypertext are the only way for the client to make state transitions and perform operations on resources. This constraint is also known as <strong>HATEOAS</strong> (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State).</p>

<h2>Links between resources</h2>

<p>In the case of a resource that contains a list of resources, REST suggests to include links to the single resources on the representation, to keep it compact and avoid redundant data.</p>

<h2>Caching to optimize time and efficiency</h2>

<p>Allows to store responses and return them if the same request is performed again. It has to be handled carefully to avoid returning stale results. The headers that allow us to perform controls over caching are:</p>

<table style="margin-bottom:16px;">
    <tr>
        <th style="font-weight:bold;padding:5px 10px;border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;">Header</th>
        <th style="font-weight:bold;padding:5px 10px;border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;">Application</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;font-weight:bold;">Date</td>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Finding out when this representation was generated</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;font-weight:bold;">Last Modified</td>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Date and time when the server modified the representation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;font-weight:bold;">Cache-Control</td>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">HTTP 1.1 header used to control caching, can contain directives</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;font-weight:bold;">Expires</td>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Expiration date (supports HTTP 1.0)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;font-weight:bold;">Age</td>
        <td style="padding:5px 10px;">Duration since the resource was fetched from server</td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p>Cache-Control values can be tweaked to control if a cached result is still valid or stale. For example, the <em>max-age</em> value indicates for how many seconds from the moment expressed by the Date header a cached result will be valid.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>REST is a language-agnostic style that abstracts over components and allows to build scalable, reusable and relatively lightweight web services. Thinking about it, it seems that REST is very close to an accurate description of the characteristics that made the World Wide Web so popular.</p>

<p>That of course is encouraging developers from all over the world to comply to these very basic ideas, owned by no one but at the same time used by everyone. Fascinating!</p>

    <id>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2015/01/23/on-strongly-typed-logging</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Logging is a crucial element of monitoring highly available systems. It allows not only to find out about errors but also quickly identify their cause. Logs are often used to generate metrics that help business and engineering make informative decisions on future development directions.</p>

<p>At OpenTable we have a central logging infrastructure, that means all logs are stored in the same shared database (ElasticSearch for us). And everybody can access any logs they want without having very specialized knowledge (thanks Kibana!).</p>

<p>ElasticSearch, though living in a NoSQL world, is not actually a schema-free database. Sure, you do not need to provide schema to it but instead ES will infer schema for you from documents you send to it. This is very similar to type inference you can find in many programming languages. You do not need to specify type of field, but if you later on try to assign inappropriate value to it you will get an exception.</p>

<p>This trait of our database goes all the way to the root of our logging system design. Let me explain why I say that we have &lsquo;strongly typed logs&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>In The Beginning There Was String</h2>

<p>Before centralization we just logged a single message along with its importance. In code it looked something like:
<code>
logger.ERROR(“Kaboom!”)
</code>
which resulted in logline on disk having timestamp, severity and message.
<code>
{2014-10-10T07:33:04Z [ERROR] Kaboom!}
</code>
That worked pretty well. As time passed we often started making log messages more generic to hold relevant data:
<code>
logger.INFO(string.Format(“Received {0} from {1}. Status: {2}. Took {3}”, httpMethod, sourceIp, statusCode, durationms));
</code></p>

<p>When we decided to centralize logs we moved the same logs from local disk to a central database. Suddenly things that used to live on single server in a file called &lsquo;application.log&rsquo; become part of one huge lump of data. Instead of easing access to logs they were really hard to filter, without even speaking about aggregation, or any simple form of operations to find the source of the problem. ElasticSearch is really good at free text searching, but frankly speaking FTS is never as precise as a good filter.</p>

<h2>Then There Was Dictionary Of Strings</h2>

<p>Wherever there is problem there is also a solution. So we changed the way our logging works. We created a custom logger and started sending logs more like documents than single string.
<code>
customLogger.send(‘info’, new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; {
{‘method’, httpMethod.ToString()},
{‘sourceIp’, sourceIp.ToString()},
{‘statusCode’, statusCode.ToString()},
{‘duration’, durationms.ToString()},
{‘requestId’, requestId.ToString()},
{‘service’, ‘myservice’}
{‘message’, string.Format(“Received {0} from {1}. Status: {2}. Took {3}”, httpMethod, sourceIp, statusCode, durationms)}
}
</code></p>

<p><strong>That helped a lot.</strong></p>

<p>You might wonder why we serialized everything to string? The answer is ElasticSearch mapping as I described above. Mapping, once it is inferred, cannot be changed. So from time to time we used to have conflicts (e.g. one application logging requestId as number, other as guid). Those conflicts were costly &ndash; logs were lost &ndash; so we simply applied the simplest solution available and serialized everything.</p>

<p>Now filtering was working fine. We were even able to group requests based on a single field and count them. You cannot imagine how useful it is to simply count the different status codes returned by a service. Also you may have noticed we introduced some extra fields like &lsquo;service&rsquo; which helped us group logs coming from a single application. We did the same with hostname etc.</p>

<p>With this easy success our appetite has grown and we wanted to log more. And being lazy programmers we found a way to do it quickly so our logs often included just relevant objects.
<code>
customLogger.log(‘info’, request)
customLogger.log(‘error’, exception)
</code></p>

<p>Our custom logging library did all the serialization for us. This worked really well. Now we were actually logging whole things that mattered without having to worry about serialization at all. What&rsquo;s even better, whenever the object in question changed (e.g. a new field was added to request), it was automagically logged.</p>

<p>However one thing was still missing. We really wanted to see performance of our application in real time or do range queries (e.g. &ldquo;show me all requests that have 5xx status code&rdquo;). We also were aware that both ES and Kibana can deliver it but our logging is not yet good enough.</p>

<h2>Strongly Typed Logs</h2>

<p>So we looked at our logging and infrastructure and at what needs to be done to allow different types of fields to live in ElasticSearch. And you can imagine that it was a pretty simple fix; we just started using types. Each log format was assigned its own type. This type was then used by ElasticSearch to put different logs into separate buckets with separate mapping. The type is equivalent in meaning to classes in OO programming. If we take this comparison further then each log entry would be an object in OO programming. ElasticSearch supports searches across multiple types, which is very convenient when you don&rsquo;t know what you are looking for. On the other hand, when you know, you can limit your query to single type and take advantage of fields types.</p>

<p>It was a big application change as we needed to completely change our transport mechanism to LogStash. We started with Gelf and switched to Redis, which allowed us to better control format of our logs.</p>

<p>We also agreed on a first standard. The standard defined that type will consist of three parts:
<code>
&lt;serviceName&gt;-&lt;logName&gt;-&lt;version&gt;
</code>
This ensures that each team can use any logs they want to (thus serviceName). Each log will have its own format (thus logName). But they can also change in the future (thus version). One little word of caution, ES doesn&rsquo;t like dots in type name, so don&rsquo;t use them.</p>

<p>So our logs look now like this:
<code>
customLogger.log(new RequestLog {
Request = request,
Headers = headers,
Status = status})
</code></p>

<p>RequestLog is responsible for providing valid type to the logging library.</p>

<p>With sending serialized objects as logs and assigning each class unique type our logs have become strongly typed.</p>

<p>We are already couple steps further down the path of improving our logs. We standardized some common fields and logtypes. That, however, is a completely different tale. ​</p>
