  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in June 2013, I wrote about <a href="http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2013/06/14/windows-feature-management-with-powershell/">Windows Feature Management with PowerShell</a>. We have since released a Puppet module that will do this for us. We originally wrote PowerShell:</p>

<pre><code>Import-Module ServerManager
Add-WindowsFeature Web-Asp-Net
</code></pre>

<p>The Puppet module now wraps this code as follows:</p>

<pre><code>windowsfeature { 'Web-Asp-Net': }
</code></pre>

<p>The declaration windowsfeature is a specific Puppet type called a <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/definedtypes.html">define</a>. In developer terms, this is the equivalent of a helper method that can be reused. We can also make sure that Windows Features are <em>not</em> installed on the server as follows:</p>

<pre><code>windowsfeature { 'Telnet-Server': 
  ensure =&gt; absent 
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the backing code for the module, we do a check before we install / uninstall any windows features. This means that we will only make the changes we really need to. This ensures idempotency of the script. By using this class, we can build up a list of what features a server should have enabled / installed on it. As example manifest would look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>class my_windows_features {
  windowsfeature { 'Web-Asp-Net': }
  windowsfeature { 'Web-Net-Ext': }
  windowsfeature { 'Web-ISAPI-Ext': }
  windowsfeature { 'Web-ISAPI-Filter': }
  windowsfeature { 'Web-Mgmt-Tools': }
  windowsfeature { 'Web-Mgmt-Console': }
  windowsfeature { 'Telnet-Server': ensure =&gt; absent }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The server will have it&rsquo;s shipping list of Windows Features checked every 30 minutes by Puppet. We are sure that any changes encountered during that time will be applied as expected.  You can find more about our WindowsFeature module on the <a href="http://github.com/opentable/puppet-windowsfeature">github repo</a>. If you want to use the module, then you can install it using the Puppet Module tool via the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/windowsfeature">Puppet Forge</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of our move towards a configuration management tool, we really wanted to start automating as much of our infrastructure as possible. This included our application configuration stack. IIS management is pretty easy with PowerShell. It would look something like this</p>

<pre><code>Import-Module WebAdministration
New-WebSite -Name "DemoSite" -Port 80 -IP * -PhysicalPath "c:\inetpub\wwwroot" -ApplicationPool "MyAppPool"
</code></pre>

<p>This would of course set up a website called &lsquo;DemoSite&rsquo; running on port 80 on the local machine. The cmdlets that come with PowerShell make this pretty easy. This is great if it is a one-off job to set up a site. We run our websites from a number of webservers, therefore, it would be silly to have to RDP into each webserver and run a script on it. This is why tools like Puppet, Chef, Ansible etc. exist. We needed a configuration management tool to do this work for us. It has a number of benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Orchestration</li>
<li>Idempotency</li>
<li>Makes sure that each server is configured in &lsquo;exactly&rsquo; the same way as no human intervention is needed</li>
<li>Developers can help the operations team by creating the scripts needed. This is great for collaboration between teams</li>
</ul>


<p>On investigating how we would do this with Puppet, we noticed that there were not many other people managing their site in this way. Therefore, we would have to turn our PowerShell scripts into Puppet modules to manage our system.</p>

<p>We have since created a Puppet module to manage IIS. To manage IIS with Puppet, we can now write the following code:</p>

<pre><code>iis::manage_site { 'DemoSite:
   site_path     =&gt; 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot',
   port          =&gt; '80',
   ip_address    =&gt; '*',
   app_pool      =&gt; 'MyAppPool'
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would produce <strong>exactly</strong> the same results as the code from above. But it has 1 difference. There are checks in the code behind this module that will mean the code will only execute when it is needed, i.e. when the site_path isn&rsquo;t correct or the app_pool isn&rsquo;t correct. This is idempotency. The script can be run again and again and again&hellip;.</p>

<p>To create an application binding, we used to do this in PowerShell:</p>

<pre><code>Import-Module WebAdministration
New-WebBinding -Name 'DemoSite' -Port '8080' -IPAddress '*'
</code></pre>

<p>This would set up an extra binding on port 8080 for the site, DemoSite. We replaced this code with our puppet equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>iis::manage_binding { 'DemoSite-8080':
  site_name   =&gt; 'DemoSite',
  protocol    =&gt; 'http',
  port        =&gt; '8080',
  ip_address  =&gt; '*',
}
</code></pre>

<p>To create a virtual application, we would write the PowerShell:</p>

<pre><code>Import-Module WebAdministration
New-WebApplication -Name 'VirtualApp' -Site 'DemoSite' -PhysicalPath 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\MyVirtualApp' -ApplicationPool 'MyAppPool'
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a VirtualApp folder on the DemoSite, use the same application pool and then set the path of the folder. I can do the same thing in Puppet as follows:</p>

<pre><code>iis::manage_virtual_application {'VirtualApp':
  site_name   =&gt; 'DemoSite',
  site_path   =&gt; 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot\MyVirtualApplication',
  app_pool    =&gt; 'MyAppPool'
 }  
</code></pre>

<p>We can therefore, chain a manifest together that does all this for us in 1 go. It would look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>class mywebsite {
  iis::manage_app_pool {'MyAppPool':
    enable_32_bit           =&gt; true,
    managed_runtime_version =&gt; 'v4.0',
  } -&gt;

  iis::manage_site {'DemoSite':
    site_path   =&gt; 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot',
    port        =&gt; '80',
    ip_address  =&gt; '*',
    app_pool    =&gt; 'MyAppPool'
  } -&gt;

  iis::manage_virtual_application {'VirtualApp':
    site_name  =&gt; 'DemoSite',
    site_path  =&gt; 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot\MyVirtualApp',
    app_pool   =&gt; 'MyAppPool'
  } -&gt; 

  iis::manage_binding {'DemoSite-8080':
    site_name  =&gt; 'DemoSite',
    protocol   =&gt; 'http',
    port       =&gt; '8080',
    ip_address =&gt; '*'
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The module does more than just these tasks and I could give more and more examples of what we wrote, but you can find more about our IIS module on the <a href="http://github.com/opentable/puppet-iis">github repo</a>. If you want to use the module, then you can install it using the Puppet Module tool via the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/iis">Puppet forge</a>.</p>

<p>We love to hear feedback on things that the module should support. We like Pull Requests even more :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last couple months I&rsquo;ve been working remotely with our search team at OpenTable. Let me share our remote working setup and some rationale for our choices. I will shy away from judging how it&rsquo;s all worked out and leave that for subsequent blog posts.</p>

<h2>The deal</h2>

<p>I started as an on-site engineer and subsequently became a remote worker and my challenge was to make remote working as similar to on-site working as possible. Thus it is natural that <strong>I work the same working hours</strong> as my colleagues in the office (despite the time difference) and I take <strong>public holidays</strong> at the same time that there are bank holidays in UK (even though in Poland they are different).</p>

<p>We also decided that every two months I will <strong>visit the office for a week</strong> as well as arranging visits to coincide with other office guests (like contractors, overseas colleagues and so on). All this is to try to keep me as close to the team as possible and disrupt the normal work-flow as little as possible.</p>

<h2>The workplace setup</h2>

<p>Once home in Poland I had to carefully consider my options for a workplace. I tried three obvious possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dining room in my own one bedroom flat</li>
<li>Co-working space</li>
<li>Private room in my parents&#8217; house</li>
</ul>


<p>The <strong>dining room</strong> worked pretty well, for a time&hellip;  I would &lsquo;arrive&rsquo; really early in the office (just after taking a shower), and then be &lsquo;home&rsquo; straight after the laptop lid was closed. My wife kindly respected that I am focused at work and distracted me only to share lunch (or to kick me out of house to bring the lunch in).</p>

<p>A couple of things made it only a short-term solution &ndash; the first being my back complaining about working on a chair that&rsquo;s nice for a dinner, but awful for working on computer. Then I realised that I really miss a second monitor and separate keyboard &ndash; I guess anybody who coded in the middle of summer on a laptop knows the pain of a hot computer under your fingers.  Finally, my child was born, and that was it &ndash; a crying child in the same room when you are trying to pair with somebody is a deal-breaker.</p>

<p>In the meantime I evaluated a local <strong>co-working space</strong>. The problem was that it was quiet, <em>really quiet</em>, up to the point that I was embarrassed to pair with somebody remotely. The way we work fluctuates over time; there are weeks when I do stuff alone and in silence, there are weeks when I spend whole days on conversations or pairing. I just cannot be too quiet. For that matter I tried also a coffee shop, but it failed me for exactly the same reasons as the dining room table.</p>

<p><strong>My little own office is currently the winner</strong> and the only way it could be better is if behind the closed doors there was my house, not my parents&#8217; one. But even this one is pretty good &ndash; I have access to an always full fridge and a decent coffee machine. I can bring my family with me and it is not awkward.</p>

<p>Finally, I can share a lunch with whoever is at home. With a decent chair and desk I cannot complain about anything. Actually, I found that even after work if we stay for a coffee or dinner I am tempted to pop in into the office and look at our dashboards or chat room.</p>

<h2>The tools setup</h2>

<p>To facilitate continuous communication <em>you first need a good attitude, and then good tools</em>. With the attitude two things matter the most:</p>

<ul>
<li>A quick response</li>
<li>Patience</li>
</ul>


<p>By nature all remote communication channels are asynchronous, which is hugely different to face-to-face communication. It is much easier this way for an important question to go unnoticed by you. Conversely it is easy to get annoyed that somebody is not responding, when in fact they may just be talking to the person at the desk next to them.</p>

<p>Our primary tool is <strong>Google Hangout</strong>. It works quite well for a team, being nice for stand-ups, though it fails miserably as a constant communication tool. There are two reasons for that; the first is that its messages often get lost and the second is it makes our MacBook radiators spin like crazy when open for too long. <em>Unfortunately we had to rule out an online window to the office after a couple of days trying</em>.</p>

<p>We also extensively use <a href="http://www.hipchat.com"><strong>HipChat</strong></a>, and that brought one of best breakthroughs in our communication patterns. It has a few features which make it great as a team collaboration tool:</p>

<ol>
<li>You get messages whether you pay attention or not</li>
<li>You can interrupt other people by mentioning them</li>
<li>It makes sharing links and images really easy</li>
<li>When you type you can collaborate with multiple persons at the same time</li>
</ol>


<p>I also mentioned that pairing is a big part of our daily work. I have to admit that I haven&rsquo;t yet found a tool that would make the experience seamless. There is always a bit of delay on the line, or shortcuts not working, or problems of mismatch between screen resolutions that would never appear when pairing on the same machine.</p>

<p>On the other hand when you have a keyboard just under your fingers it is much easier to swap sides and while discussing actually write code constructs. For this we use combination of <strong>Hangout</strong> screen share feature (for quick debug help) and <strong>RDP</strong>.</p>

<p>One last tool that I like to use quite extensively is <strong>Google Drive</strong> as a shared whiteboard. It has proved to be especially useful for retrospectives or architecture discussion. The nice thing about the Drive draw tool is that it forces you to use shapes, lines and text. Those three primitives allow for an unlimited number of possible drawings. Being vector means you can easily move stuff around (nothing will fall on the floor), you never run out of space and you have an immediate and lasting backup of your board. I also found that a distributed retrospective facilitates a more equal participation of those attending.</p>

<p>The best feature of the most of those tools is that they allow to <strong>easily save and store the outcomes of your conversations.</strong> Hangouts can be recorded, HipChat naturally creates history of chats and Google Drive&rsquo;s drawings become a persistent track of team discussions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Prioritisation is a huge part of modern life.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Prioritisation is an ESSENTIAL part of modern life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not talking solely about Agile here either. Yes we plan stories, yes we prioritise them to get them into the backlog but I&rsquo;m aiming at a higher level. Life lessons that are useful to all of us.</p>

<p>How do we know what to do next? Perhaps you lean on your gut feeling to order your to-do list. Maybe it is real-time cost and budget implications that influence your priorities or does it come down to who shouts loudest?</p>

<h2>Why is prioritisation important?</h2>

<p>The experts would have us believe we are living through the Digital Age, also know as the Computer Age. Increasingly this has been more accurately redefined as the Information Age.</p>

<p>The society we live in today truly bombardes us with information. Whether it be TV, mobile, emails, blog posts, status updates, tweets, likes and check-in&rsquo;s we are rarely unconnected to modern day life and have a vast amount of data and information at our disposal.</p>

<p>This flood of information leads to a problem: we often confuse the importance of everyday tasks and activities.</p>

<p>For instance how many times have we said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time to read&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to be able to go to the gym more&rdquo;. Perhaps a more honest way to say this is &ldquo;reading is not a high priority for me&rdquo; or &ldquo;I prioritise other activities higher than going to the gym&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The decision not to spend time reading or working-out in the gym means you are spending time on other activities you consider more important. Consciously or unconsciously, we prioritise our life. The key is to prioritise effectively.</p>

<h2>The Focus Quadrant</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been introduced to a framework that helped me to grab this idea of effective prioritisation and certainly opened my eyes to some of the mistakes I made previously.</p>

<p>Stephen Covey, a sadly deceased educator, author and businessman, designed a matrix called The Focus Quadrant that categorises activities and helps us deal with the struggle of prioritisation by clearly outlining the conflicts involved.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.chowamigo.co.uk/images/focus.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<table style="font-size: 80%;margin-bottom:20px;">
    <tr>
        <th style="padding:3px;"></th>
        <th style="padding:3px;"><b>Description</b></th>
        <th style="padding:3px;"><b>Examples</b></th>
    </tr>
<tr style="background-color: #E5E5E5">
    <td style="white-space:nowrap;padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">A. Important/Urgent</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Tasks that are necessary usually deadline driven or time sensitive. This usually this means panic and problems.</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Fixing the server crash, firefighting a site outage, entering expenses before a deadline</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td style="white-space:nowrap;padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">B. Important/Not urgent</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Activities in direct alignment to your goals. Typically these tasks involve planning ahead. Prevention rather than cure.</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Relationship building, researching your next API, learning a new coding language, taking time out to exercise</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #E5E5E5">
    <td style="white-space:nowrap;padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">C. Not important/Urgent</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Activities that seem important but in reality are not. It&#8217;s thought these tasks will make you popular as you are responding to requests for your time.</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Going to a meeting, answering the phone, replying instantly on IMs or email</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td style="white-space:nowrap;padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">D. Not important/Not urgent</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">While it would seem pleasant enough to live here permentantly, in reality these activities are time wasters that should be eliminated as much as possible.</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Playing video games, surfing the net, getting a tea or coffee, flicking through the magazine on your desk</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h2>How does this help?</h2>

<p>Covey&rsquo;s point is that if we have a long list of items and activities and we are struggling to prioritise them, spending 20 minutes writing the list down and assigning each task A, B, C or D can help clarify importance.</p>

<p>For me the interesting part is that we should not be spending too much time in A. This goes against our natural reaction that A is good &ndash; probably the fault of our education system. In fact category A is considered beneficial only in the short term. We are not overly productive even if we spend a lot of time on A category tasks. We really want to shift our attention to more longer term plans.</p>

<p>Category B on the other hand is considered the sweet spot. This is where we are doing our best work. It is where we will be ticking off a lot of our important long term goals. Yes we all have different goals but the majority of the goals we want to achieve fit into B &ndash; non urgent and important.</p>

<p>For category C there is a great saying &lsquo;The quadrant of deception&rsquo;. These are tasks we THINK are urgent but in reality they are not. Considered to be a distraction, get used to politely saying no to any activities in the C category. We should look to regain control of our time and not be forced to respond when it suits others.</p>

<p>Finally category D is the worst place to spend your time. It&rsquo;s okay to roam across each of these four quadrants but if we identify we are spending too much time in quadrant D we need to step back, reassess and pick up a task more aligned to our goals &ndash; ideally something from category B.</p>

<h2>Money => mouth</h2>

<p>While this is useful in theory, we of course need to be realistic. You should factor in time for impromptu interruptions &ndash; saying no to every meeting isn&rsquo;t possible and this isn&rsquo;t an excuse to push back difficult tasks. However, the next time your to-do list gets unmanageable, take time out to clarify your priorities.</p>

<p>Now my current my to-do list looks like this&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>Investigate a blip in our API performance <strong><code>(A)</code></strong></li>
<li>Scope out our next API <strong><code>(B)</code></strong></li>
<li>Improve the way our current API deploys to production <strong><code>(B)</code></strong></li>
<li>Send out a team update to interested parties <strong><code>(C)</code></strong></li>
<li>Go and grab a cup of tea :) <strong><code>(D)</code></strong></li>
</ol>

To do this effectively we are always looking for <a href="/blog/2014/02/28/api-benchmark/">new</a> <a href="/blog/2013/08/16/grunt-plus-vagrant-equals-acceptance-test-heaven/">tools</a> <a href="/blog/2014/04/07/upgrading-puppet-with-puppet/">and</a> <a href="/blog/2014/02/10/the-adoption-of-configuration-management/">methods</a> that allow us, the developers, to respond quickly and accurately to changing requirements and environments.</p>

<p>There are a number of practices that we already make use of, helping us to be the most effective team I&rsquo;ve ever worked in:</p>

<ul>
<li>We operate in small teams who each own <em>most</em> of their own vertical.</li>
<li>We use continuous delivery to ship code to production within minutes.</li>
<li>We have a high degree of high-quality test coverage.</li>
<li>We are getting better and better at monitoring All The Things.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2013/11/22/beginning-a-journey-to-chatops-with-hubot/">We use Chatops</a>, so communication is central to our work, and keeps remote workers/teams in the loop.</li>
</ul>


<p>All of the above are truly empowering for the dev team, and are conducive to an amazingly stress-free working environment. However, these practices only address the infrastructure, culture, and ceremony surrounding our work. What if there was something else? Something about the way we write the code itself, that could increase our velocity yet further, without compromising our integrity&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>There are a number of practices that we already make use of, helping us to be the most effective team I&rsquo;ve ever worked in&hellip; What if there was something else?</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, on a recent project, we found one such way: <em><em>we decided to delete all of the unit and integration tests</em></em>.</p>

<p><em>What?! Are we quite mad?</em> You may be thinking&hellip; Well, it took me a little time to get used to this idea as well, but read on and you&rsquo;ll see that it was actually the most sane thing we could have possibly done  .</p>

<h2>Survival of the testedest</h2>

<p>In the beginning, the project had 100% unit test coverage, there were no external dependencies, and the world was Good.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, a tall shadow appeared in the glorious unit-tested sunset. External dependencies had arrived. Like good little developers we added integration tests. It hurt, our codebase grew, we had occasional false-failures, but we were travelling the path well trodden. We had evaded the First Menace, and surrounded ourselves with heavy armour, we were safe. Things seemed to be Good.</p>

<p><em>Meanwhile&hellip;</em></p>

<p>We realised that some of the things that would be important to our consumers were still not covered by our tests. Things like actual HTTP responses, serialisation, and the like. These are things that don&rsquo;t always need to be tested explicitly, but since this was a third-party-developer-facing system, we really wanted to be sure that the interface worked exactly as we wanted, HTTP headers, character encoding, date formatting, the lot.</p>

<p>So, playing the role of our consumers, we engineered high-level acceptance tests, behaving byte-for-byte as we expected our customers to do.</p>

<p>Now, with the triple-action protection of three layers of tests, we felt our project was the most minty-fresh piece of haute engineering we had ever laid keyboards on.</p>

<p>We were wrong.</p>

<h2>Tests, tests, tests, duplication.</h2>

<p>Up to this point, we had operated in a near-vacuum. That was fine, we had been working quickly to implement a sub-set of an existing and well-used API, so we knew which were the most important features that needed porting. We continued, largely happy with our creation, for some time.</p>

<p><em>Then, gazing up from the receding tide of the third trimester were the hungry eyes of the Second Menace. Our users were upon us!</em></p>

<p>Our early adopters were great, giving us a lot of helpful feedback and helping us shape the API into a genuinely usable v1. However, responding to this change required a greater degree of flexibility in the code than we had required up to this point. Our triple-chocolate-crunch of pithy tests was starting to really slow us down, and rot our teeth. The main reason for this: duplication.</p>

<p>We had tried from the start to avoid any duplication in our tests, but this was all but impossible to achieve. You just can&rsquo;t test an API call end-to-end in an acceptance-test style, without inadvertently testing all of the underlying logic for that call. Code which was already covered by unit tests, and often integration tests as well. Therefore each move we made came with the burden of updating multiple tests. Often materially very similar tests, but written to test a different layer of the same cake. We were between an immovable monolith and a very heavy boulder&mdash;and had a hoarde of features we still wanted to smash, who were freely bounding over the mountain tops, and out of reach.</p>

<p>It was time to cut ourselves free.</p>

<h2>Ripping off the plaster</h2>

<p>The idea that we might not need all these layers of tests was first mooted by fellow OpenTable engineer Arnold Zokas. My initial reaction was one of slight incredulity. Delete all those tests that we&rsquo;ve so carefully caressed and cajoled into a thing of beauty?! Strip off the armour?! I wasn&rsquo;t immediately convinced. However, the pain of implementing new features was starting to burn, so I was interested.</p>

<blockquote><p>I wasn&rsquo;t immediately convinced.</p></blockquote>

<p>We talked about it&mdash;what was necessary about the unit tests? What was their real worth? We had to test many of those things from the outside-in anyway, with the acceptance tests, so why test them twice? The logic started to stack up. I was convinced this was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Take a deep breath. <em>RIP!</em> Aah, there, done.</p>

<p>There was a little bleeding, some gaps in our acceptance tests that had to be filled, some complex set-up logic from the integration tests that had to be ported to work with the acceptance tests. A few days&#8217; worth of cleanup and patching in the background, and&hellip; tentatively&hellip; we were done.</p>

<p>For me at least, this was a bold move. But it shouldn&rsquo;t have seemed so, we knew all of our endpoints were acceptance-tested, including every supported API call. My primary worry was how we were going to nail down the exact cause of bugs with no code-level testing. This turned out to be nowhere near as bad as I expected.</p>

<blockquote><p>We knew all of our endpoints were acceptance-tested, including every supported API call.</p></blockquote>

<h2>What just happened?</h2>

<p>I like to visualise this as if we were building <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Arch">a giant arch</a>. At first, you build a temporary structure with scaffolding (the unit and integration tests). As time goes on you construct a hardened permanent structure (the software). On top of the software, you layer your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_health_monitoring">structural integrity monitors</a> (acceptance tests). Eventually, there is no need for the scaffolding any more; the structure is self-supporting, and future modifications can rely on this&mdash;time to punch out the middle!</p>

<p><em>Of course, there are other considerations, like logging, monitoring, and providing sandbox data, which all contributed to making this feasable&mdash;but that&rsquo;s for another post.</em></p>

<h2>Was it worth it?</h2>

<p>Unequivocally, yes. Since making this decision, we have been unhindered by our tests, and they are back to being a much loved part of the project. We have had no problems that would have been caught by unit tests, and we can still do TDD with our acceptance tests. In addition, I think removing the crutch of unit tests may have improved our discipline somewhat: <em>it keeps us thinking in the context of the end-user at all times, so we never spend time working on a feature that isn&rsquo;t directly useful to our consumers.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>It keeps us thinking in the context of the end-user at all times, so we never spend time working on a feature that isn&rsquo;t directly useful to our consumers.</p></blockquote>

<h2>YMWMCV</h2>

<p>Of course, every project is unique (just like every other project), so <em>your mileage will most certainly vary.</em> We were working on a stateless facade over a small but crucial subset of the business&mdash;making reservations. For relatively small, stateless projects, this approach has worked brilliantly. However, when things do go wrong at development time, they could be at any layer in the stack, and you often need to attach a debugger to find out what happened. This is less than ideal, but in our case was a very cost-effective compromise.</p>

<p>The upshot, for me at least, is that you shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to shirk convention when the project demands it. By really analysing what each part of your project is doing, you can cut the cruft, helping you move faster <em>without</em> breaking stuff.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of one of our recent <a href="http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/04/04/forgefriday-our-commitment-to-the-puppet-forge/">ForgeFriday</a> efforts we released a new module puppetversion with the purpose of managing the installation and upgrade of Puppet in a platform agnostic way.</p>

<p>This should be a very straightforward task to complete because this is one of the core resources that Puppet manages &ndash; the upgrading of packages. With that in mind, putting <code>package { ‘puppet’: ensure =&gt; $version }</code> in one of our base profiles would be all that was needed but alas it was not. In this blog I want to take you through the history, the bugs, the platforms and the edge-cases that make performing an in-place upgrade of Puppet a more complex task that it ought to be.</p>

<h2>Debian</h2>

<p>Like many, Ubuntu is our Debian derivative of choice for much of our newer production infrastructure. Debian, has the apt package management system and PuppetLabs provide the required deb packages as well as hosting their own apt repository to point our systems to. The main point of package management systems is that they take care of the dependency hell and the awkward upgrade paths all from within the confines of the package itself, and that is what happens with the PuppetLabs packages &ndash; great.</p>

<p>The problem that we had in some of our systems was that they had been built without the PuppetLabs apt repository. This means that they picked up a slightly older version of the Puppet packages from the main Ubuntu distribution repositories and didn’t have access to the newer versions of the Puppet packages. Ok, so we solved that with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>  exec { 'rm_duplicate_puppet_source':
    path    =&gt; '/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin',
    command =&gt; 'sed -i \'s:deb\ http\:\/\/apt.puppetlabs.com\/ precise main::\' /etc/apt/sources.list',
    onlyif  =&gt; 'grep \'deb http://apt.puppetlabs.com/ precise main\' /etc/apt/sources.list',
  }

  apt::source { 'puppetlabs':
    location    =&gt; 'http://apt.puppetlabs.com',
    repos       =&gt; 'main dependencies',
    key         =&gt; '4BD6EC30',
    key_content =&gt; template('puppetversion/puppetlabs.gpg'),
    require     =&gt; Exec['rm_duplicate_puppet_source']
  }
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;re making use of the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apt">puppetlabs/apt</a> module here. This removes the old reference and adding in the new apt source. Then we just add the package and ensure the version we’re upgrading. Perfect.</p>

<h2>RedHat</h2>

<p>Same problem different OS family &ndash; this time we had some older CentOS machines that needed fixing. Thankfully there is also a module <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/stahnma/puppetlabs_yum">stahnma/puppetlabs_yum</a> for the yum repositories. Add that in, add the package resource and start upgrading. Phew! This seems like it’s getting easier.</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>Many of you will be following the work of OpenTable closely because of our work with Puppet on Windows. We have a pretty large Windows infrastructure, with a wide range of client and server versions deployed ranging from 2012 R2 all the way back to the historic times of 2003. Windows also has its own package format, the msi, and PuppetLabs also provides all versions of Puppet packaged as msi files.</p>

<p>This is where it gets a little tricky. The big problem we had was that the Windows provider, prior to 3.4.0 was not versionable (<a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/21133">issues/21133</a>) that means that <code>package { ‘puppet’: ensure =&gt; installed }</code> would work but <code>package { ‘puppet’: ensure =&gt; $version }</code> would not &ndash; the exact thing we were trying to do! The only way to resolve that problem is to uninstall and reinstall the package with the correct version.</p>

<p>Now there are a lot of problems with the uninstall/reinstall approach. Firstly we had to script the process because Windows only allows one installer to run at any one time meaning that you had to wait for the uninstall to finish before that subsequent install takes place. Secondly we have to deal with Puppet runs and make sure that when the upgrade script runs that we wait for any active Puppet runs to complete before trying to uninstall Puppet. Next we have to trigger our script using a scheduled task.</p>

<p>Our experience with scheduled tasks has been painful. We attempted using the <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#scheduledtask">scheduled_task</a> resource type but soon realised that this wasn’t going to work for us. The resource type is good if you want to create a task to run at a fixed point in time but there is no way to provide a relative time e.g. “in five mins from now”. Also on occasion the task would not run or would silently fail &ndash; this was almost certainly due to another Puppet issue we discovered (<a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1368">PUP-1368</a>). Without being able to use the scheduled task resource we were again back in the land of Powershell using a script to create the scheduled task that would call our upgrade script.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re keeping up we now have something like this:</p>

<p>Puppet &ndash;> calls script to create scheduled task &ndash;> scheduled task calls upgrade script &ndash;> upgrade script upgrade Puppet and triggers next Puppet run &ndash;> Puppet</p>

<p>Nice little cycle there, but it works.</p>

<p>One final issue worth mentioning is that for Windows 2003 servers you’ll need to actually have Powershell installed. Luckily, we also have a module for that <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/dcharleston/powershell">dcharleston/powershell</a></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Well we’ve discussed some of the pain points, and we’ve discussed them in detail with PuppetLabs themselves. The advice here is to upgrade to Puppet 3.4.3 as soon as you can as many of these issues are resolved in that version. For those of you not on that version yet then we have you covered with our puppetversion module.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One afternoon I got asked to write a new Puppet module to manage local users on our Linux boxes. Not a contrived example but a real-world need as we begin to move our infrastructure from Windows to Linux. Managing users is one of those tasks that is at the core of the Puppet ecosystem and I thought this would be pretty easy as I had done this sort of thing many times before. What added to the complexity was that we needed to support Ubuntu, Centos and FreeBSD machines that we had in our stack and we wanted to make it something that was open source and on the Forge &ndash; so lots of testing was required.</p>

<p>This was not the first module that I had written for the Forge but it was the first that I had written since PuppetLabs had introduced their new acceptance testing framework <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker">Beaker</a> and so I wanted to spend some time getting the module working with this new tool.</p>

<h2>Beaker</h2>

<p>The purpose of Beaker is to allow you to write acceptance tests for your modules, that is to write some manifests that use your module and test them out on a virtual machine. Some of you may remember <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/rspec-system-puppet">rspec-system-puppet</a> was previously used to accomplish this, well PuppetLabs has since deprecated that in favour of Beaker but the premise is very much the same.</p>

<p>Using rspec-puppet for unit testing your manifests really only goes so far. If you&rsquo;re just using the standard Puppet resources then it pretty safe to assume that it does what it says on the tin (I mean PuppetLabs really test their stuff!) but as soon as you start doing things that are a little more complex, using exec statements, custom facts, custom functions or targeting multiple operating systems then you&rsquo;re really going to want to make sure that once the catalogs compile that they are doing what they are meant to be doing and this is where your acceptance test suite will come in.</p>

<p>With Beaker you can spin up a virtual machine, install modules, apply a manifest and then test what really happened.</p>

<p>Beaker works with many different hypervisor technologies but most people will be using <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> so that is what I will cover here.</p>

<h3>Configuring Beaker</h3>

<p>The first thing in configuring your existing project to use Beaker is to add “beaker” and “beaker_rspec” to you Gemfile. You&rsquo;re then going to want to create a new spec_helper file called spec_helper_acceptence.rb that should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>require 'beaker-rspec/spec_helper'
require 'beaker-rspec/helpers/serverspec'

hosts.each do |host|
  install_puppet
end

UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = ['Suse','windows','AIX','Solaris']

RSpec.configure do |c|
  proj_root = File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..'))

  c.formatter = :documentation

  # Configure all nodes in nodeset
  c.before :suite do
    puppet_module_install(:source =&gt; proj_root, :module_name =&gt; 'homes')
    hosts.each do |host|
      on host, puppet('module','install','puppetlabs-stdlib'), { :acceptable_exit_codes =&gt; [0,1] }
      on host, puppet('module', 'install', 'opentable-altlib'), { :acceptable_exit_codes =&gt; [0,1] }
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This contains quite a bit of new setup that you won’t have seen before. Beaker contains lots of useful helper methods for doing all the things that you&rsquo;re going to want to do when running Puppet against a virtual machine; install Puppet (so your boxes don’t have to have it pre-baked), installing local modules and installing modules from the Forge. We also specify the platforms that we don’t support &ndash; we’ll make use of this later.</p>

<p>The next step is to define some machines that we want to set against. Beaker calls these nodesets because while in most cases you’ll only want to test one host machine at a time, Beaker does support testing multi-node configurations for more complex scenarios. Looking at the homes project your directory structure will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>puppet-homes
  manifests
  spec
    acceptance
      nodesets
        centos-64-x64.yml
        default.yml
        ubuntu-server-12042-x64.yml
      homes_spec.rb 
    defines
    fixtures
    spec_helper.rb
    spec_helper_acceptance.rb
  tests 
</code></pre>

<p>A nodeset is simply a yaml file that specifies the box name, where it downloads it from, its platform and the hypervisor you are using. A example from the homes module below:</p>

<pre><code>HOSTS:
  ubuntu-server-12042-x64:
  roles:
    - master
  platform: ubuntu-12.04-amd64
  box : ubuntu-server-12042-x64-vbox4210-nocm
  box_url : http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/ubuntu-server-12042-x64-vbox4210-nocm.box
  hypervisor : vagrant
CONFIG:
  log_level: verbose
  type: git
</code></pre>

<p>More detail about how to configure these yaml files can be found on the Beaker wiki, <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/wiki/Creating-A-Test-Environment">Creating A Test Environment</a></p>

<p>In the above example I am using Vagrant boxes provided by PuppetLabs but there are a few other sources to discover already pre-built boxes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/">http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/">http://www.vagrantbox.es/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vagrantcloud.com">https://vagrantcloud.com</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Writing tests in Beaker</h3>

<p>So now that we have our environment set up let’s look at actually writing some tests. Here is an example from the homes project:</p>

<pre><code>require ‘spec_helper_acceptance'

describe 'homes defintion', :unless =&gt; UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORMS.include?(fact('osfamily')) do

  context 'valid user parameter’ do

    it 'should work with no errors’ do
      pp = &lt;&lt;-EOS
        $myuser = {
        'testuser' =&gt; { 'shell' =&gt; '/bin/bash' }
      }

      homes { 'testuser':
        user =&gt; $myuser
      }
      EOS

      apply_manifest(pp, :catch_failures =&gt; true)
      expect(apply_manifest(pp, :catch_failures =&gt; true).exit_code).to be_zero
   end

   describe user('testuser') do
     it { should exist }
   end

   describe file('/home/testuser') do
     it { should be_directory }
   end
 end

end
</code></pre>

<p>In this case we are writing a test to make sure that when our module runs, it creates the user and its home directory as it expects. Using the UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORMS that we defined earlier we can also skip groups of tests if they are not supported on the current node.</p>

<p>The idea here is that we define a manifest (using Heredoc &ndash; but please don’t make them too long!) and then we want to apply that manifest to the node. Beaker provides a nice helper methods that: apply_manifest. In our case we run it once, which will cause the changes and then we run it a second time with the scope of a test to check for idempotency. We can then make use of Beaker’s resource based helpers to actually test the functionality on the node itself. Their many helper methods will allow you to do almost everything that you need to do, either for setup purposes or for actually testing the node:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/wiki/The-Beaker-DSL-API">The-Beaker-DSL-API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/blob/master/lib/beaker/dsl/helpers.rb">beaker/dsl/helpers.rb</a></li>
</ul>


<p>It’s actually worth noting that Beaker makes heavy use of <a href="https://github.com/serverspec/serverspec">serverspec</a> which you should go and take a look at.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>So now you know a little about testing Beaker with Puppet go forth and test all your modules against everything that you expect your users to be running it on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Those of you that read this blog on a regular basis will be aware that here at OpenTable we take our commitment to Open Source very seriously. As part of the infrastructure team at OpenTable we are begining a process of being open-first. That means that everything we write will be open-sourced unless it contains a significant amount of internal information but we will architect to limit this.</p>

<p>As part of that commitment we are trying to release all our Puppet configuration. The key to maintaining any good habit is to do little and often and with that in mind we wanted to let you know about ForgeFriday.</p>

<p>Every Friday we will be releasing our Puppet code onto the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable">PuppetLabs Forge</a> (until we run out of modules). That means all our Windows modules, all our forks, our experiments, our custom facts and functions &ndash; anything and everything will start rolling out on Fridays.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just forge and forget either, we will continue to support all of our modules and those that use them. We will blog about some of the bigger, more important ones and continue to engage with the community as much as possible. If you&rsquo;re using our modules (even if you have no issues) then let us know &ndash; we&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>

<p>In the meantime go and check out what we have already released:</p>

<p><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/windowsfeature">opentable/windowsfeature</a> &ndash; Module that will turn Windows features on or off<br/>
<a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/iis_rewrite">opentable/iis_rewrite</a> &ndash; Module that will install the IIS Rewrite 2.0 Module on Windows <br/>
<a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/remaster">opentable/remaster</a> &ndash; Module for managing the remaster of agent nodes <br/>
<a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/puppetversion">opentable/puppetversion</a> &ndash; Module for managing the installation and upgrade of Puppet<br/>
<a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/altlib">opentable/altlib</a> &ndash; Module providing some additional useful functions <br/></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I18n is often a painful afterthought when serving content from a http-api. It can be taken for granted and tacked on using nasty query string values. But thankfully HTTP provides us with a solid gold opportunity. If you can look past the mire of content negotiation you can see the nuggets that lie inside.</p>

<p>The accept-language header is used by most browsers and allows websites to serve content in a language that the user can (hopefully) understand. When we expose content from an api (in most of our use cases, at least), this content eventually ends up in front of a human (in some shape or form). Having our service-service communication serve localised resources can be invaluable because it frees the clients from having to think about i18n of the resources being served from our api.</p>

<p>It is a simple part of the HTTP specification and is widely used and supported.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>GET /product/123
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Language: en-US</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The accept-language header is specifically designed to allow the server to provide a representation of the resource which approximates something the client can understand.</p>

<p>The really useful bit comes from the quality value.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>GET /product/123
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This header asks the service to provide en-US, and if it&rsquo;s unavailable then fall back to <strong>any</strong> english representation. The quality value (<code>q=0.8</code>) is a decimal value between 0 and 1 which indicates order of preference when specifying multiple languages. The server should pick the <strong>first</strong> available match. If there are multiple matches with the same quality value, then the server can pick any. If the client wants to specify some fierce preferences then they can crank out something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>GET /product/123
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Language: fr-CA,fr-FR;q=0.8,fr;q=0.6,en-US;q=0.4,en;q=0.2,*;q=0.1</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you decipher this it&rsquo;s pretty simple, you can see the quality headers giving the order in which the languages are preferred. What it does is give the client fantastic flexibility. For service-service communication you might have a use-case which will <em>never</em> serve a representation that doesn&rsquo;t match the request, or you might need to <em>always</em> provide some representation (i.e. for cases where some content is always better than none).</p>

<p>The accept-language header gives you that flexibility. In my opinon, if your http-api&rsquo;s are serving content that <em>can</em> be internationalised, the server should always support this type of behaviour because it can shift the control from the server to the client. It allows the server&rsquo;s behaviour to be incredibly explicit and the clients get all that lovely flexibility.</p>

<p><strong>What happens when there is no matching representation?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the specification is (intentionally) vague. In other words, it is up to the server to decide. I myself always prefer to be explicit. Thankfully the HTTP specification provides for just such an eventuality.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html">HTTP 406 Not Acceptable</a> <em>&ldquo;The resource identified by the request is only capable of generating response entities which have content characteristics not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The 406 response <em>should</em> contain a list of characteristics which the resource does support. In this case, a list of available languages. The specification does allow the server to automatically select a representation to return, however in my opinion, the server should be explicit, rather than implicit.</p>

<p>If the client has a use case where it <em>always</em> requires some sort of response (i.e. where any content is better than no content), then the client can append a wildcard to the end of the accept-language header, which will instruct the server to fall back to <em>any</em> language, in the event that there are none matching.</p>

<p><strong>Parsing the Accept-Language header</strong></p>

<p>I wrote a little npm module to help us in <a href="https://github.com/andyroyle/accept-language-parser">parsing the accept-language header</a>. Once you get past the (somewhat hairy) regex, it&rsquo;s a simple little bit of code. (Disclaimer, I&rsquo;m not a regex god, so there are a couple of little bugs in it).</p>

<p>Parsing an accept-language string such as <code>en-US,en;q=0.8</code> gives an object looking like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[
</span><span class='line'>  {
</span><span class='line'>    code: "en",
</span><span class='line'>    region: "GB",
</span><span class='line'>    quality: 1.0
</span><span class='line'>  },
</span><span class='line'>  {
</span><span class='line'>    code: "en",
</span><span class='line'>    region: undefined,
</span><span class='line'>    quality: 0.8
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>];</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Output is always sorted in quality order from highest &ndash;> lowest. as per the http spec, omitting the quality value implies 1.0.</p>

<p>We can pass this around our application and use it to select the representation which best matches the client&rsquo;s request.</p>

<p><strong>Using it</strong></p>

<p>We use <a href="http://hapijs.com">hapi.js</a> for some of our api&rsquo;s (and I&rsquo;m very much in love), we use this module in a pre-requisite handler in our route:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var alparser = require('accept-language-parser');
</span><span class='line'>server.route({
</span><span class='line'>  method: "GET",
</span><span class='line'>  path: "/v5/restaurants/{id}",
</span><span class='line'>  config: {
</span><span class='line'>    pre: [
</span><span class='line'>      {
</span><span class='line'>        method: function(req, next){
</span><span class='line'>          next(alparser.parse(req.raw.req.headers["accept-language"] || ""));
</span><span class='line'>        },
</span><span class='line'>        assign: "language",
</span><span class='line'>        mode: "parallel"
</span><span class='line'>      }
</span><span class='line'>    ],
</span><span class='line'>    handler: function(req, reply){
</span><span class='line'>        ...
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>});</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For those of you that don&rsquo;t know, the prerequisites run before the handler, and assign their values to the request object. You can now get hold of the parsed language object here:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>req.pre.language</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Content-Negotiation is hard</strong></p>

<p>Yes, it is. But suck it up. In my opinion the benefits outweigh the costs. Besides, the Accept-Language header is part of the HTTP specification and is well understood. If you have doubts, start small, and always try to be <em>explicit</em> rather than implicit.</p>

<p><strong>Gotchas</strong></p>

<p>Caching (both client-side and intermediate) can be picky. By default, most caches won&rsquo;t respect the header content (i.e. the resource is cached by url only). You can get around this by using vary-headers:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>GET /product/123
</span><span class='line'>Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.8
</span><span class='line'>Vary: Accept-Language</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This instructs the cache that the response will vary with the value of Accept-Language, so when this changes it should be cached as a separate resource. Vary headers <strong>should</strong> be applied by the client to the request, however the server can apply them to the response if necessary.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="/blog/2014/03/19/performance-testing-our-search-api/">my last post</a> about performance testing I wrote about how we decided to do it in production as the ultimate test of success. Performance testing in production is enough to make some operations guys have a panic attack and a few odd looks were dished my way when I raised it on behalf of the team.</p>

<h2>Why not have a dedicated environment?</h2>

<p>If you can have a dedicated environment that you can build to be EXACTLY the same as where you are going to really need the performance (i.e. your production environment most likely, but possibly on a client machine) then do it in a dedicated, duplicated environment. Alternatively if there is no way you can use the production environment or your model means that everything will scale exactly like production, then a duplicate environment might work.</p>

<p>For us, we had too many dependencies, mocking these out wasn&rsquo;t really satisfactory and frankly, as a business where we are quiet at night, it is easy to use the production environment at these times. We use configuration management and virtual machines, much of what should help build a replica environment, but we also have machines in restaurants around the globe. That is not easy to replicate and not worth the effort.</p>

<h2>Even if you can have a duplicated environment should you?</h2>

<p>We felt in the search team that we just wouldn&rsquo;t uncover a broken server (that can affect performance) or we wouldn&rsquo;t see that we had a problem with interactions with these services (we have now got to serialisation as our bottleneck, maybe we would have missed that).</p>

<p>We just didn&rsquo;t trust that a duplicated environment would actually help us in this case. If you want to test a new idea as a prototype then the duplicate will probably work, even if just at first, we were trying to improve our actual environment.</p>

<h2>Is testing in production right?</h2>

<p>There is no &lsquo;right&rsquo; answer here, plenty of people test in a duplicate environment and then monitor in production. I think this is probably a valid approach and in a lot of use cases this would be fine for us too.</p>

<p>Can you micro-optimise in a huge production system?  Probably not, so use a scaled down duplicate for that or even a local environment such as one created using Vagrant. Hopefully with enough micro-optimisations you will eventually see these in a larger environment.</p>

<h2>Is it a free lunch?</h2>

<p>Testing in production is not a free lunch. Even simple things like system logging will cost as you will be logging to production data centres, probably with backup costs etc. Do you need to code-in safeguards? Yes, and you will need to watch this running from your desk. When you are not watching it will be hard to be sure you will not cause production issues. We can use our regional environment that means we are testing during our day, that region&rsquo;s night, other companies might see you having to work in your timezone&rsquo;s evening &ndash; not fun.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>Whilst, on the face of it, testing in production seems crazy, with all things considered we found it the easiest, most reliable and frankly most reassuring environment in which to test.</p>
