    <updated>2014-10-31T10:14:04+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/10/31/coach-dont-rescue</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently attended a fascinating and emotionally-charged talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/sisoma">Samantha Soma</a> at <a href="https://2014.dareconf.com">DareConf 2014</a>, <a href="http://vimeo.com/108047198">&lsquo;How to stop rescuing people&rsquo;</a>. It strongly mirrored my experience of moving into a leadership role and I&rsquo;d recommend anyone with a spare 30mins to watch it.</p>

<p>Samantha&rsquo;s talk made me reflect on how I struggle to coach talented individuals; how I can identify when it&rsquo;s going wrong and what steps I can take to remedy the situation.</p>

<h2>Gold star syndrome</h2>

<p>A new concept for me and a recurring theme throughout the sessions at DareConf, &lsquo;Gold Star Syndrome&rsquo; is a fixation on finding validation for your work. I feel this is a result of early childhood values spinning the perception of working life away from the actual reality. As a child, especially during our school years, we discovered that when we do good things, good things happen to us. Remember how it felt to get that gold star in your spelling test or that A+ on an English essay?</p>

<p>That was great in school and even through to University but working life is a much more terse environment and getting positive reenforcement is much less common. As professionals, the majority of our work goes unnoticed &ndash; until there is a problem or issue to solve. Then we feel open to the stinging criticism but resentful that months of good work went unnoticed.</p>

<p>When we continue to search for a gold star or continually strive for perfectionism we, as individuals, become much more insular and isolated. We tend to avoid showing our work until it is 100% ready and put up a shield to protect us from any feedback, in fear of being made to look stupid or being called a fraud.</p>

<h2>Empowerment</h2>

<p>There is a considerable amount of <a href="http://whatworksforhealth.wisc.edu/program.php?t1=20&amp;t2=6&amp;t3=84&amp;id=311">research</a> to suggest children who have bad experiences and manage to overcome them tend to grow up to become more rounded adults. By encouraging grit and allowing kids to solve their own problems, children learn they are empowered. They become more creative, more respectful, less dependant on others and display less problem behaviour.</p>

<p>This is also relatively easy to implement and can be as simple as involving children in a decision-making process. &lsquo;What do you want to eat with dinner; carrots or broccoli&rsquo;? This might progress to &lsquo;What colour socks do you want to wear?&rsquo; or &lsquo;Which swing do you want to play on?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The concept of preventing yourself from controlling a situation is really key to successful coaching. Rescuing people by dictating an outcome  requires one weak person and one strong person. This propagates itself so people drift towards being a victim or a rescuer. A much better outcome would be a group of confident, empowered individuals who are able to work together.</p>

<h2>Provide tools not solutions</h2>

<p>Even if they are unaware themselves, individuals we coach don&rsquo;t want a solution to their problem. What they want is for you to help them find their own solution. To paraphrase a great line in Samantha&rsquo;s presentation &ndash; &lsquo;Our role is to give people a view of the life they want instead of giving them the life we think they want.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And how can we start doing that? I have started to adopt Samantha&rsquo;s principles and have been staggered by how effective they are in practice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://outsmartyourbrain.com/find-your-emotional-triggers-on-this-list/">Know your triggers</a> &ndash; what words and situations make you race to help a colleague in distress? Are there patterns you can spot and say &lsquo;Hang on I&rsquo;ve been here before&rsquo;?</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.successrockets.com/Blog-Professional-Personal-Development/bid/51210/Leadership-Development-Skill-Detached-Involvement">Maintain engaged detachment</a> &ndash; this is tough and requires us to build and nurture a certain skill set; if all else fails remember <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-ann-kennedy/not-my-circus-not-my-monk_b_5390455.html">&lsquo;Not my circus, not my monkeys&rsquo;</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_85.htm">Appreciative Inquiry</a> &ndash; there are lots of models and frameworks out there but in essence Appreciative Inquiry  boils down to asking someone lots of questions and listening intently to their response, however difficult!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://centerx.gseis.ucla.edu/xchange/teacher-leadership/teacher-workroom/reflecting-conversation">Challenge them to reflect on what happened</a> &ndash; before an individual can see past the problem, they need to acknowledge the problem and the events that lead them there.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.reallifecoaching.net/tips-on-committing-to-your-goals/">Ask them to articulate what they want to happen next</a> &ndash; coach them through how this problem can be solved and what steps they might take to resolve it. This commitment helps to clarify any misunderstanding and sets a clear path forward for coach and coachee.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.myinternalgps.com/?p=1149">Celebrate their success</a> &ndash; a pat on the back (mentally or physically) can go a long way. Why should individuals receive feedback when there is a problem? Loop back with people and celebrate the small wins as much as possible.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Leaders are not lifeguards!</h2>

<p>While not exactly child&rsquo;s play, I hope you have read enough here to spot the danger signs and modify your approach away from the rescuer role that ultimately helps no one.</p>

<p>Effective leaders stop jumping to the rescue and start coaching people through a bad experience, empowering individuals by providing them with the tools to come to their own conclusions and solve their own problems.</p>

    <updated>2014-08-08T13:52:30+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/08/08/what-can-i-do</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed recently a lot of content in my social media network is based on the current escalating problems in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Whenever I see such content from a friend or follower, I&rsquo;m reminded of Stephen Covey&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00GOZV3TM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00GOZV3TM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=helenpieli-21&amp;linkId=RTIUTRBYIE6APBJA">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a> &ndash; Circle of Influence, Circle of Concern.</p>

<p>Covey says that in order to remain truly effective, we should focus our time and energy on situations we can influence. Don&rsquo;t worry about things we cannot control, such as the weather, the economy or indeed foreign conflicts.</p>

<p>Covey&rsquo;s work implies that if we identify the areas that are inside our Circle of Influence we will be more productive and make more of an impact;</p>

<p><img src="http://www.chowamigo.co.uk/images/what_can_i_do.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m honest I find this work quite harsh in its approach. Indeed it might not sit well with everyone. However, I personally found myself much less burdened once I could identify which problems I had control over.</p>

<h2>Expand your influence</h2>

<p>I still find myself watching the news, reading press reports and shaking my head at the global problems we&rsquo;ve yet to solve. Covey&rsquo;s stance is a tough one to take &ndash; don&rsquo;t waste energy on X, your time and resources are better utilised by focusing on what you can change.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m concerned about global warming => recycle waste as best you can, be energy efficient with your devices, insulate your home more effectively.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m concerned about my finances => learn new skills, look for a better role, try to control your spending, reduce unnecessary outgoings.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m concerned about my health => get a check up, start to eat healthily, take regular exercise, reduce tobacco and alcohol intake.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>What I like about Covey&rsquo;s advice is that it&rsquo;s sending a clear message &ndash; are we able to make the sun shine at weekends? Can we solve the UK economic crisis by next month? Is there really anything we can do to bring about peace in the Middle East? The likely answer for most of us is no. We  simply have no control on areas outside of our power.</p>

<p>But if you step back into your circle of influence and be pro-active, you can make a real difference.</p>

    <link href="http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/04/28/effective-prioritisation/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-28T14:51:51+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/04/28/effective-prioritisation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Prioritisation is a huge part of modern life.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Prioritisation is an ESSENTIAL part of modern life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not talking solely about Agile here either. Yes we plan stories, yes we prioritise them to get them into the backlog but I&rsquo;m aiming at a higher level. Life lessons that are useful to all of us.</p>

<p>How do we know what to do next? Perhaps you lean on your gut feeling to order your to-do list. Maybe it is real-time cost and budget implications that influence your priorities or does it come down to who shouts loudest?</p>

<h2>Why is prioritisation important?</h2>

<p>The experts would have us believe we are living through the Digital Age, also know as the Computer Age. Increasingly this has been more accurately redefined as the Information Age.</p>

<p>The society we live in today truly bombardes us with information. Whether it be TV, mobile, emails, blog posts, status updates, tweets, likes and check-in&rsquo;s we are rarely unconnected to modern day life and have a vast amount of data and information at our disposal.</p>

<p>This flood of information leads to a problem: we often confuse the importance of everyday tasks and activities.</p>

<p>For instance how many times have we said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time to read&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to be able to go to the gym more&rdquo;. Perhaps a more honest way to say this is &ldquo;reading is not a high priority for me&rdquo; or &ldquo;I prioritise other activities higher than going to the gym&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The decision not to spend time reading or working-out in the gym means you are spending time on other activities you consider more important. Consciously or unconsciously, we prioritise our life. The key is to prioritise effectively.</p>

<h2>The Focus Quadrant</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been introduced to a framework that helped me to grab this idea of effective prioritisation and certainly opened my eyes to some of the mistakes I made previously.</p>

<p>Stephen Covey, a sadly deceased educator, author and businessman, designed a matrix called The Focus Quadrant that categorises activities and helps us deal with the struggle of prioritisation by clearly outlining the conflicts involved.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.chowamigo.co.uk/images/focus.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<table style="font-size: 80%;margin-bottom:20px;">
    <tr>
        <th style="padding:3px;"></th>
        <th style="padding:3px;"><b>Description</b></th>
        <th style="padding:3px;"><b>Examples</b></th>
    </tr>
<tr style="background-color: #E5E5E5">
    <td style="white-space:nowrap;padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">A. Important/Urgent</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Tasks that are necessary usually deadline driven or time sensitive. This usually this means panic and problems.</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Fixing the server crash, firefighting a site outage, entering expenses before a deadline</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td style="white-space:nowrap;padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">B. Important/Not urgent</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Activities in direct alignment to your goals. Typically these tasks involve planning ahead. Prevention rather than cure.</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Relationship building, researching your next API, learning a new coding language, taking time out to exercise</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #E5E5E5">
    <td style="white-space:nowrap;padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">C. Not important/Urgent</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Activities that seem important but in reality are not. It's thought these tasks will make you popular as you are responding to requests for your time.</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Going to a meeting, answering the phone, replying instantly on IMs or email</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td style="white-space:nowrap;padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">D. Not important/Not urgent</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">While it would seem pleasant enough to live here permentantly, in reality these activities are time wasters that should be eliminated as much as possible.</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Playing video games, surfing the net, getting a tea or coffee, flicking through the magazine on your desk</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h2>How does this help?</h2>

<p>Covey&rsquo;s point is that if we have a long list of items and activities and we are struggling to prioritise them, spending 20 minutes writing the list down and assigning each task A, B, C or D can help clarify importance.</p>

<p>For me the interesting part is that we should not be spending too much time in A. This goes against our natural reaction that A is good &ndash; probably the fault of our education system. In fact category A is considered beneficial only in the short term. We are not overly productive even if we spend a lot of time on A category tasks. We really want to shift our attention to more longer term plans.</p>

<p>Category B on the other hand is considered the sweet spot. This is where we are doing our best work. It is where we will be ticking off a lot of our important long term goals. Yes we all have different goals but the majority of the goals we want to achieve fit into B &ndash; non urgent and important.</p>

<p>For category C there is a great saying &lsquo;The quadrant of deception&rsquo;. These are tasks we THINK are urgent but in reality they are not. Considered to be a distraction, get used to politely saying no to any activities in the C category. We should look to regain control of our time and not be forced to respond when it suits others.</p>

<p>Finally category D is the worst place to spend your time. It&rsquo;s okay to roam across each of these four quadrants but if we identify we are spending too much time in quadrant D we need to step back, reassess and pick up a task more aligned to our goals &ndash; ideally something from category B.</p>

<h2>Money => mouth</h2>

<p>While this is useful in theory, we of course need to be realistic. You should factor in time for impromptu interruptions &ndash; saying no to every meeting isn&rsquo;t possible and this isn&rsquo;t an excuse to push back difficult tasks. However, the next time your to-do list gets unmanageable, take time out to clarify your priorities.</p>

<p>Now my current my to-do list looks like this&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>Investigate a blip in our API performance <strong><code>(A)</code></strong></li>
<li>Scope out our next API <strong><code>(B)</code></strong></li>
<li>Improve the way our current API deploys to production <strong><code>(B)</code></strong></li>
<li>Send out a team update to interested parties <strong><code>(C)</code></strong></li>
<li>Go and grab a cup of tea :) <strong><code>(D)</code></strong></li>
</ol>

    <link href="http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/02/03/coaching-style-over-substance/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-03T11:12:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/02/03/coaching-style-over-substance</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been lucky enough to mentor someone who really got it? Maybe you&rsquo;ve had the opposite experience and the session ended up being a failure for both of you?</p>

<p>We are fortunate enough to be in an industry that gives us the chance to coach others and have a direct influence on the learning of individuals around us. But how do we know when we&rsquo;re doing it right, or more importantly what can we do when it starts to go wrong?</p>

<h2>Know your student, find their style</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the science behind how we learn.</p>

<p>The first recognised attempt to identify different approaches individuals use in order to learn was David Kolb with the book &lsquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Experiential-Learning-Experience-Source-Development/dp/0132952610">Experimental Learning</a>&rsquo;. Kolb suggested that humans have a range of learning techniques available to us and that we tend to lean on one learning style above all others.</p>

<p>In recent times his research has proved to be inaccurate &ndash; yes people have different learning styles, yes they  show an emphasis in one particular style but Kolb&rsquo;s definition of separate styles was confused.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles#Peter_Honey_and_Alan_Mumford.27s_model">Honey and Mumford and their 1999 adaptation on Kolb&rsquo;s model</a>. They identified four distinct learning styles which have since grown to be the preferred assessment of human learning styles.</p>

<table style="font-size: 80%;margin-bottom:20px;">
    <tr>
        <th style="padding:3px;"></th>
        <th style="padding:3px;"><b>Description</b></th>
        <th style="padding:3px;"><b>Learn best</b></th>
        <th style="padding:3px;"><b>Learn worst</b></th>
    </tr>
    <tr style="background-color: #E5E5E5">
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;"><b>Activists</b></td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Enjoy doing, tend to act first and think later. They like working with others but often hog the limelight.</td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">When involved in new experiences, being thrown in the deep end and leading discussions.</td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Listening to long lectures, reading or writing on their own. Following precise information to the letter.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;"><b>Reflectors</b></td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Like to stand back, listen to others, look at the situation, gather data and carefully come to a conclusion.</td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Observing individuals or teams at work,  reviewing what has happened and what they have learned from it.</td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Acting as a leader in front of others, doing things without preparation, being rushed by deadlines.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="background-color: #E5E5E5">
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;"><b>Theorists</b></td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Able to adapt and integrate observations into complex theories. Tend to be perfectionists. Detached and analytical rather than emotive.</td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">When put into complex and structured situations having to apply their skill and knowledge. Have the chance to question and probe ideas.</td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">With unstructured or poorly briefed activities. Will struggle in situations where emphasise is put on emotion or feelings.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;"><b>Pragmatists</b></td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Practical and down to earth. Keen to try things out they can be impatient especially with long discussions.</td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Respond well to demonstrations of techniques that show an obvious advantage.</td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Learning is all theory. No guidelines on how to accomplish activity. No apparent pay back.</td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p>The important thing to remember is not all individuals can be pigeon-holed into one group. These characteristics are evident across all industries and teams; I can certainly see myself and others in this list. Can you?</p>

<p>Now we can silo and identify behaviour, we can look deeper into the flow of learning.</p>

<h2>Complete the circle</h2>

<p>Let me introduce you to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bernice-mccarthy/15/564/715">Bernice McCarthy</a>. Bernice has been in education for more than 30 years so it&rsquo;s not surprising she has an insight into her field. During her time in education she spotted a pattern and designed a framework that increased the success rate of individual learning.</p>

<p>Research suggests that this framework (<a href="http://www.4mat.eu/">4MAT</a>) is proven to be successful as it follows the thought processes of individuals when they try to learn. It works by explaining not just the WHY? but also the WHAT?, the HOW? and the WHAT IF?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.chowamigo.co.uk/images/4mat.png" alt="image" /></p>

<ol>
<li><p>WHY? => Convey the meaning and purpose of the change in order to engage people. <strong>Engage the why</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>WHAT? => Once it&rsquo;s made relevant provide facts, structure or theory to explain what is going to happen. <strong>Inform the what</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>HOW? => Focus on the problems and how best to solve them. <strong>Applying the how</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>WHAT IF? => Ask questions and experiment. What else, what&rsquo;s next. <strong>Learn by doing</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So how is this helpful?</p>

<p>If we look at the the 4MAT framework and overlay the 4 learning styles from Honey and Mumford we can see some obvious similarites:</p>

<p>PRAGMATISTS = WHY?</p>

<p>ACTIVISTS = WHAT?</p>

<p>THEORISTS = HOW?</p>

<p>ACTIVISTS = WHAT IF?</p>

<p>This is really useful to know, by following the 4MAT framework you are reaching out to each learning style and increasing your chances of being successful in your role as a coach, mentor or teacher.</p>

<h2>Theory schmery, how does this work in practice?</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy enough for us to read this information and take it in, forget about it, move on.</p>

<p>But if we look at a real-world scenario, something that is relevant to our industry and is generally a tough problem to sell it&rsquo;ll make it more tangible. In my world, that can be breaking apart a legacy application that has become too difficult to work with.</p>

<p><strong>WHY?</strong>
We have a monolithic website right now. The code is too complicated, has no obvious structure and is very tough to change. We need to be able to release solid code, fast.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT?</strong>
The fact is we are struggling to maintain this application and we can forget about adding new features. Even small updates are causing outages. As a result our site performance has degraded to unacceptable levels.</p>

<p><strong>HOW?</strong>
The initial thought from the team is to break the monolith into identifiable pieces of functionality. We will try to get each piece behind an API. We hope to abstract the front-end code away so it communicates to these new endpoints.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IF?</strong>
What if we refactor with the MVP pattern first and see where the duplication lies? Is there an argument to leave the non-urgent areas of the site until the appetite is there to attack them? We think REST APIs are the way to go, what are your thoughts?</p>

<h2>Do, there is no try</h2>

<p>Outlining and truly grasping these styles can really help push learning in your team further. Try reaching out to different learning styles and see how people respond.</p>

<p>Maybe you are pairing on a tricky feature, struggling to get your point across. Perhaps you have a tough decision that you need to sell to your team. Let&rsquo;s say you are lucky enough to speak at a conference in front of hundreds of delegates &ndash; you could do a lot worse than to remember <strong>WHY?</strong>   <strong>WHAT?</strong> <strong>HOW? </strong> <strong>WHAT IF?</strong></p>
