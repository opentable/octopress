    <id>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/10/31/coach-dont-rescue</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently attended a fascinating and emotionally-charged talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/sisoma">Samantha Soma</a> at <a href="https://2014.dareconf.com">DareConf 2014</a>, <a href="http://vimeo.com/108047198">&lsquo;How to stop rescuing people&rsquo;</a>. It strongly mirrored my experience of moving into a leadership role and I&rsquo;d recommend anyone with a spare 30mins to watch it.</p>

<p>Samantha&rsquo;s talk made me reflect on how I struggle to coach talented individuals; how I can identify when it&rsquo;s going wrong and what steps I can take to remedy the situation.</p>

<h2>Gold star syndrome</h2>

<p>A new concept for me and a recurring theme throughout the sessions at DareConf, &lsquo;Gold Star Syndrome&rsquo; is a fixation on finding validation for your work. I feel this is a result of early childhood values spinning the perception of working life away from the actual reality. As a child, especially during our school years, we discovered that when we do good things, good things happen to us. Remember how it felt to get that gold star in your spelling test or that A+ on an English essay?</p>

<p>That was great in school and even through to University but working life is a much more terse environment and getting positive reenforcement is much less common. As professionals, the majority of our work goes unnoticed &ndash; until there is a problem or issue to solve. Then we feel open to the stinging criticism but resentful that months of good work went unnoticed.</p>

<p>When we continue to search for a gold star or continually strive for perfectionism we, as individuals, become much more insular and isolated. We tend to avoid showing our work until it is 100% ready and put up a shield to protect us from any feedback, in fear of being made to look stupid or being called a fraud.</p>

<h2>Empowerment</h2>

<p>There is a considerable amount of <a href="http://whatworksforhealth.wisc.edu/program.php?t1=20&amp;t2=6&amp;t3=84&amp;id=311">research</a> to suggest children who have bad experiences and manage to overcome them tend to grow up to become more rounded adults. By encouraging grit and allowing kids to solve their own problems, children learn they are empowered. They become more creative, more respectful, less dependant on others and display less problem behaviour.</p>

<p>This is also relatively easy to implement and can be as simple as involving children in a decision-making process. &lsquo;What do you want to eat with dinner; carrots or broccoli&rsquo;? This might progress to &lsquo;What colour socks do you want to wear?&rsquo; or &lsquo;Which swing do you want to play on?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The concept of preventing yourself from controlling a situation is really key to successful coaching. Rescuing people by dictating an outcome  requires one weak person and one strong person. This propagates itself so people drift towards being a victim or a rescuer. A much better outcome would be a group of confident, empowered individuals who are able to work together.</p>

<h2>Provide tools not solutions</h2>

<p>Even if they are unaware themselves, individuals we coach don&rsquo;t want a solution to their problem. What they want is for you to help them find their own solution. To paraphrase a great line in Samantha&rsquo;s presentation &ndash; &lsquo;Our role is to give people a view of the life they want instead of giving them the life we think they want.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And how can we start doing that? I have started to adopt Samantha&rsquo;s principles and have been staggered by how effective they are in practice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://outsmartyourbrain.com/find-your-emotional-triggers-on-this-list/">Know your triggers</a> &ndash; what words and situations make you race to help a colleague in distress? Are there patterns you can spot and say &lsquo;Hang on I&rsquo;ve been here before&rsquo;?</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.successrockets.com/Blog-Professional-Personal-Development/bid/51210/Leadership-Development-Skill-Detached-Involvement">Maintain engaged detachment</a> &ndash; this is tough and requires us to build and nurture a certain skill set; if all else fails remember <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-ann-kennedy/not-my-circus-not-my-monk_b_5390455.html">&lsquo;Not my circus, not my monkeys&rsquo;</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_85.htm">Appreciative Inquiry</a> &ndash; there are lots of models and frameworks out there but in essence Appreciative Inquiry  boils down to asking someone lots of questions and listening intently to their response, however difficult!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://centerx.gseis.ucla.edu/xchange/teacher-leadership/teacher-workroom/reflecting-conversation">Challenge them to reflect on what happened</a> &ndash; before an individual can see past the problem, they need to acknowledge the problem and the events that lead them there.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.reallifecoaching.net/tips-on-committing-to-your-goals/">Ask them to articulate what they want to happen next</a> &ndash; coach them through how this problem can be solved and what steps they might take to resolve it. This commitment helps to clarify any misunderstanding and sets a clear path forward for coach and coachee.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.myinternalgps.com/?p=1149">Celebrate their success</a> &ndash; a pat on the back (mentally or physically) can go a long way. Why should individuals receive feedback when there is a problem? Loop back with people and celebrate the small wins as much as possible.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Leaders are not lifeguards!</h2>

<p>While not exactly child&rsquo;s play, I hope you have read enough here to spot the danger signs and modify your approach away from the rescuer role that ultimately helps no one.</p>

<p>Effective leaders stop jumping to the rescue and start coaching people through a bad experience, empowering individuals by providing them with the tools to come to their own conclusions and solve their own problems.</p>

    <updated>2014-08-08T13:52:30+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/08/08/what-can-i-do</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed recently a lot of content in my social media network is based on the current escalating problems in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Whenever I see such content from a friend or follower, I&rsquo;m reminded of Stephen Covey&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00GOZV3TM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B00GOZV3TM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=helenpieli-21&amp;linkId=RTIUTRBYIE6APBJA">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a> &ndash; Circle of Influence, Circle of Concern.</p>

<p>Covey says that in order to remain truly effective, we should focus our time and energy on situations we can influence. Don&rsquo;t worry about things we cannot control, such as the weather, the economy or indeed foreign conflicts.</p>

<p>Covey&rsquo;s work implies that if we identify the areas that are inside our Circle of Influence we will be more productive and make more of an impact;</p>

<p><img src="http://www.chowamigo.co.uk/images/what_can_i_do.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m honest I find this work quite harsh in its approach. Indeed it might not sit well with everyone. However, I personally found myself much less burdened once I could identify which problems I had control over.</p>

<h2>Expand your influence</h2>

<p>I still find myself watching the news, reading press reports and shaking my head at the global problems we&rsquo;ve yet to solve. Covey&rsquo;s stance is a tough one to take &ndash; don&rsquo;t waste energy on X, your time and resources are better utilised by focusing on what you can change.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m concerned about global warming => recycle waste as best you can, be energy efficient with your devices, insulate your home more effectively.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m concerned about my finances => learn new skills, look for a better role, try to control your spending, reduce unnecessary outgoings.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m concerned about my health => get a check up, start to eat healthily, take regular exercise, reduce tobacco and alcohol intake.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>What I like about Covey&rsquo;s advice is that it&rsquo;s sending a clear message &ndash; are we able to make the sun shine at weekends? Can we solve the UK economic crisis by next month? Is there really anything we can do to bring about peace in the Middle East? The likely answer for most of us is no. We  simply have no control on areas outside of our power.</p>

<p>But if you step back into your circle of influence and be pro-active, you can make a real difference.</p>

    <link href="http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/04/28/effective-prioritisation/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-28T14:51:51+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/04/28/effective-prioritisation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Prioritisation is a huge part of modern life.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Prioritisation is an ESSENTIAL part of modern life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not talking solely about Agile here either. Yes we plan stories, yes we prioritise them to get them into the backlog but I&rsquo;m aiming at a higher level. Life lessons that are useful to all of us.</p>

<p>How do we know what to do next? Perhaps you lean on your gut feeling to order your to-do list. Maybe it is real-time cost and budget implications that influence your priorities or does it come down to who shouts loudest?</p>

<h2>Why is prioritisation important?</h2>

<p>The experts would have us believe we are living through the Digital Age, also know as the Computer Age. Increasingly this has been more accurately redefined as the Information Age.</p>

<p>The society we live in today truly bombardes us with information. Whether it be TV, mobile, emails, blog posts, status updates, tweets, likes and check-in&rsquo;s we are rarely unconnected to modern day life and have a vast amount of data and information at our disposal.</p>

<p>This flood of information leads to a problem: we often confuse the importance of everyday tasks and activities.</p>

<p>For instance how many times have we said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time to read&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to be able to go to the gym more&rdquo;. Perhaps a more honest way to say this is &ldquo;reading is not a high priority for me&rdquo; or &ldquo;I prioritise other activities higher than going to the gym&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The decision not to spend time reading or working-out in the gym means you are spending time on other activities you consider more important. Consciously or unconsciously, we prioritise our life. The key is to prioritise effectively.</p>

<h2>The Focus Quadrant</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been introduced to a framework that helped me to grab this idea of effective prioritisation and certainly opened my eyes to some of the mistakes I made previously.</p>

<p>Stephen Covey, a sadly deceased educator, author and businessman, designed a matrix called The Focus Quadrant that categorises activities and helps us deal with the struggle of prioritisation by clearly outlining the conflicts involved.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.chowamigo.co.uk/images/focus.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<table style="font-size: 80%;margin-bottom:20px;">
    <tr>
        <th style="padding:3px;"></th>
        <th style="padding:3px;"><b>Description</b></th>
        <th style="padding:3px;"><b>Examples</b></th>
    </tr>
<tr style="background-color: #E5E5E5">
    <td style="white-space:nowrap;padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">A. Important/Urgent</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Tasks that are necessary usually deadline driven or time sensitive. This usually this means panic and problems.</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Fixing the server crash, firefighting a site outage, entering expenses before a deadline</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td style="white-space:nowrap;padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">B. Important/Not urgent</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Activities in direct alignment to your goals. Typically these tasks involve planning ahead. Prevention rather than cure.</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Relationship building, researching your next API, learning a new coding language, taking time out to exercise</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #E5E5E5">
    <td style="white-space:nowrap;padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">C. Not important/Urgent</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Activities that seem important but in reality are not. It's thought these tasks will make you popular as you are responding to requests for your time.</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Going to a meeting, answering the phone, replying instantly on IMs or email</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td style="white-space:nowrap;padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">D. Not important/Not urgent</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">While it would seem pleasant enough to live here permentantly, in reality these activities are time wasters that should be eliminated as much as possible.</td>
    <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Playing video games, surfing the net, getting a tea or coffee, flicking through the magazine on your desk</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h2>How does this help?</h2>

<p>Covey&rsquo;s point is that if we have a long list of items and activities and we are struggling to prioritise them, spending 20 minutes writing the list down and assigning each task A, B, C or D can help clarify importance.</p>

<p>For me the interesting part is that we should not be spending too much time in A. This goes against our natural reaction that A is good &ndash; probably the fault of our education system. In fact category A is considered beneficial only in the short term. We are not overly productive even if we spend a lot of time on A category tasks. We really want to shift our attention to more longer term plans.</p>

<p>Category B on the other hand is considered the sweet spot. This is where we are doing our best work. It is where we will be ticking off a lot of our important long term goals. Yes we all have different goals but the majority of the goals we want to achieve fit into B &ndash; non urgent and important.</p>

<p>For category C there is a great saying &lsquo;The quadrant of deception&rsquo;. These are tasks we THINK are urgent but in reality they are not. Considered to be a distraction, get used to politely saying no to any activities in the C category. We should look to regain control of our time and not be forced to respond when it suits others.</p>

<p>Finally category D is the worst place to spend your time. It&rsquo;s okay to roam across each of these four quadrants but if we identify we are spending too much time in quadrant D we need to step back, reassess and pick up a task more aligned to our goals &ndash; ideally something from category B.</p>

<h2>Money => mouth</h2>

<p>While this is useful in theory, we of course need to be realistic. You should factor in time for impromptu interruptions &ndash; saying no to every meeting isn&rsquo;t possible and this isn&rsquo;t an excuse to push back difficult tasks. However, the next time your to-do list gets unmanageable, take time out to clarify your priorities.</p>

<p>Now my current my to-do list looks like this&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>Investigate a blip in our API performance <strong><code>(A)</code></strong></li>
<li>Scope out our next API <strong><code>(B)</code></strong></li>
<li>Improve the way our current API deploys to production <strong><code>(B)</code></strong></li>
<li>Send out a team update to interested parties <strong><code>(C)</code></strong></li>
<li>Go and grab a cup of tea :) <strong><code>(D)</code></strong></li>
</ol>

    <link href="http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/02/12/programme-management/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-12T10:16:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/02/12/programme-management</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Popular topic at conferences</h2>

<p>A lot of us were lucky enough to attend NDC London this year, we even sponsored one of the food stalls. I often see one or more real themes coming from talks at conferences. At NDC London I saw three talks around scaling Agile. Indeed Dan North&rsquo;s (<a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod">@tastapod</a>) talk was called exactly that. It is a topic OpenTable is trying to make happen. We are about 100 engineers on three continents which is a lot of teams working together.</p>

<p>I truly believe that the only way to make an individual team successful in an Agile environment is to have ownership of an area, a system or similar. That enables fast feedback, quick decision making and also a sense of pride and responsibility for what people are working on.</p>

<p>However, when you have a big project, you can&rsquo;t give it to just one team. You need many teams working together. You can split it up and get teams to work on the parts of the project affecting the code they own. This will though mean certain parts of the project go faster than others, and if teams are autonomous, who is really responsible for bringing all those pieces together? Also, imagine you are the project owner and need to have a rough handle on when things can actually be delivered, who is going to give you that? None of the individual teams know, everyone is Agile and cool and so everyone hates estimates.</p>

<p>The point made by three speakers at NDC London, <a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod">Dan North</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble">Jez Humble</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gojkoadzic">Gojko Adzic</a> came down to the need for the coordination piece across the teams. One thing Dan North (more or less) said is <em>&ldquo;if your team is really fast and all the others are slow, the project is slow and your team haven&rsquo;t achieved their goal&rdquo;</em>. That was not the exact words he used but the sentiment came across.</p>

<p>Indeed we have some big projects at OpenTable and as we have properly embraced Agile in many ways, we still had some pain points in this exact area. We were getting to the same conclusions but since these talks we have had some more solid programme management and in the third cross-team meeting as a result, things starting taking shape. It really is an important piece of the jigsaw.</p>

<p>I would also recommend a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILP1pJAuT9c&amp;list=PLBMFXMTB7U74NdDghygvBaDcp67owVUUF&amp;feature=c4-overview-vl">DevDay talk</a> from Dariusz Dziuk on this and how Spotify make things scale. Slightly different content but a similar theme.</p>

    <link href="http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/02/06/20-percent-time/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-06T17:12:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/02/06/20-percent-time</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We allow all our UK based developers to have some time to explore new technologies, try out prototypes and clean-up things that escape the day-to-day process. Two days out of ten, seems a lot doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<h2>How we started</h2>

<p>We started doing our 20% time when we had two week sprints with a release each sprint. We actually had three days of testing, small bug fixing and signing things off. We didn&rsquo;t like starting our new stories for the next sprint as our QAs got behind and never really caught up. We decided to use this time more for clean-up but also for prototyping or trying something out. We had read of other companies doing something similar so were excited to give it a go.</p>

<p>One of the first times we did this we actually decided we wanted to automate all the testing of one of our systems, so that our QAs weren&rsquo;t bogged down for those three days. In our first 20% time, we got most of the team on board as it was painful watching, let alone doing manual testing and we wanted faster feedback on our changes.</p>

<p>We got a lot of the system in a state we could test it. We basically wrote a lot of a page object model and a few features to talk to it. The next 20% time it needed cleaning up, the next we had a lot under test. With a bit of work the three day test cycle was down to about one day. This would never have happened if we were trying in normal sprint time. Major win number one and something no business owner had had to wrestle against other priorities.</p>

<p>After this instance we have had numerous similar examples, albeit on a smaller scale, where each team has been able to try things out, with no consequence in the event of failure, and achieved great prototypes. Much of our new architecture has been tested out in these sessions, new technologies, new approaches, can people work together?</p>

<h2>Failures, not so bad after all</h2>

<p>Of course, we have had many failures, but maybe even that helps, we won&rsquo;t waste our proper sprint time. Some people ask me about rules when I talk about this. I think the key for me is that the engineers are truly given freedom to explore. If on the face of things something they are doing is completely away from what you are doing then it might seem a bit strange.</p>

<p>But what if they are looking to try something new and would have left your company to do so? What if they think it might be a solution but don&rsquo;t know how to say? What if they can use it in nine months on an urgent project? All these things can and have happened.</p>

<h2>Fear, as always, is detrimental</h2>

<p>Another rule, <em>no fear</em>,  applies in many situations of course. But unlike hackathons where you feel the need to present at the end, presenting should be through excitement of the creator, not demand of the manager.</p>

<h2>Better team as a result</h2>

<p>I have seen our whole UK engineering group get a lot stronger through our use of 20% time. We have also been more attractive in interviews and gets very positive responses when discussing our job openings; so many developers just want an opportunity to learn and apply new skills and will leave a job to do so.</p>

<p>I personally now have a child, attempting to try new skills and experiment at home is proving harder and harder. This 20% time becomes more important &ndash; as a team we are trying to really get to grips with the latest trends in the development community. I just don&rsquo;t have anywhere near as much time in the evenings now, it is a way to stop a divide coming between your team, the ones with spare time and the ones without.</p>

<p>I recommend giving it some serious thought for your organisation.</p>
